# Wisp's Unofficial Mod Repo

## What this?

This is a big json file of many Starsector mods. It is automatically updated twice a day.

It is created by gathering data from the USC Discord server and the official Forum, then merging it all
together.

It's free for anybody to use, although I would love to hear if you are using it so we can talk about breaking changes if
needed.

The source code is located here: <https://github.com/wispborne/SMOL/tree/dev/Mod_Repo>. I accept ideas and consider
pull requests.

## Opting Out

Opting out is a work in progress and is currently just possible for Discord posts.

- Discord: React to your post with the ðŸ•¸ emoji.

## FAQ

- Does this download my files?
  - No. It grabs links, but never downloads anything.
- My mod is Discord-only, does this let anyone download it?
  - Depends. If the files were only uploaded to Discord, then no, users will need a USC Discord account to download it. However, if you linked to a website like GitHub for the download (which is public), then anyone can download it.
- What is this used for?
  - SMOL and MOSS, so far.
- How is it updated?
  - I have a Raspberry Pi that auto-runs the program twice a day and commits the result to GitHub. My contributions streak has never been better.

## Mod Sources

Mods from different sources will be merged into one mod if either of the following merging methods succeeds:

1. Fuzzy matching of the mod name and author (both must roughly match).
2. Checking for a link to the official forum; if both mods point to the same page, they're merged.

### Forum

With permission, this uses JSoup to scrape the Mod Index as well as the Mods and Modding subforums.

It does _not_ load each individual mod page, only the list of topics, and uses a regex (`[\[{]([^]}]*?\d+?[^]}]*?)[]}]`)
to look for the game version in a forum topic to determine if it's a mod post or some other random post.

#### Data

- Name
- Author
- Forum url

### Discord

With permission, uses a bot account to read all messages in the #mod_updates channel of
the [USC server](https://discord.gg/a8AWVcPCPr) using the official Discord API.

The first non-blank line in the post is assumed to be the name of the mod, and markdown is stripped from it.

The summary is the next two lines.

The description is everything after the first non-blank line.

The repo also looks for a link to the forum as well as a download link.

The search for a download link is prioritized and looks like this:

```kotlin
messageLines
    .mapNotNull { urlFinderRegex.find(it)?.value }
    .prefer { it.contains("/releases/download") }
    .prefer { it.contains("/releases") }
    .prefer { it.contains("dropbox") }
    .prefer { it.contains("drive.google") }
    .prefer { it.contains("patreon") }
    .prefer { it.contains("bitbucket") }
    .prefer { it.contains("github") }
    .prefer { it.contains("mediafire") }
```

Note: The mod repo does not download files, nor expose mods that are uploaded to Discord as attachments. If a mod is not
uploaded outside of Discord, the user will need a USC Discord account to download it.

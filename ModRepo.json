These mods should be 100% compatible with all other mods excluding major overhauls that aren't normally compatible with any other mods.\n\nChangelog:\nNew Drones+\nVanilla+\n\nI only updated the version for Vanilla+ and New Drones+. Did some light testing and it worked. Dunno about submods, I haven't touched them since... I think 0.96? 🤷 \n\n\nMods available:\nAll the Domain Drones+ Vanilla\nRecommended new save. I cannot guarantee this mod will work on an existing save (Motherships won't make drone fleets on existing games).\nThis mod modifies Vanilla drones, increasing their stats. It also upgrades the Domain Faction and allows Motherships and Survey Ships to spawn Derelict fleets as if they were [REDACTED] Battlestations. \n\nDownload Link:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxqxz8w8j4zemrx/Domain%20Drones%2B%20Vanilla.rar?dl=1\n\nAll the Domain Drones+ New Drones\nShould work on existing saves for newly generated Domain fleets/garrisons.\nThis mod adds new Domain Drones. Capital ships, Cruisers, Destroyers, fuel ships, cargo ships, frigates, wings, mining ships, carriers and a new buildable Derelict Station (with three Tiers) to colonies. Also adds proper survey ships and probes to those explorable. Overhauls the Mothership into a more threatening station. Derelict stations can also appear as Pirate stations, these send Derelict raids (you can also buy ships from them, don't ask why). \n\nDownload Link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxdaflon17jhg2k/All%20the%20Domain%20Drones%2B%20New%20Drones.rar?dl=1",

LunaLib is required to use LunaSettings (though Settings.editme still works)\n\nInstall and press J in combat, in refit, or on the world map to open a GUI.\n\nFeatures:\n- Many tags, such as targeting or avoiding shields, PD mode and many many more\n- GUI-based configuration in combat/refit or on the campaign map\n- Ability to automate tags via automatic customizable suggested tags and fleet-wide weapon-composition based tags\n- Tags are automatically saved between combats and reloads\n- Seamlessly switch between simple mode (6 tags) and advanced mode (over 20 tags)\n- Customize AI-controlled ship behavior through ship modes in advanced mode\n- Customize most aspects of the mod through LunaLib settings\n- Manually control multiple weapon groups at once using the Merge tag\n\nCan be updated/added/removed to/from ongoing campaigns.\n\n```\nTo mod-authors:\nIf you want to integrate with AGC to improve ship/weapon AI behavior of your faction, check the readme. Feel free to ping me if you need help or want to request a special mode.\nExample integration code: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-symbiotic-void-creatures/blob/main/src/tecrys/svc/hullmods/BGECarapace.kt#L98\n```\n\nVideos:\nAGC 1.15 Showcase: https://youtu.be/N5SIRMo7Pxc\nAGC in 60s: https://youtu.be/2T3xNqy2HQA\n\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21280.0\nDownload: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/releases",

I'm also adding some tough, cheap and short range fighters to fit in your makeshift hangar bay.\n\n```Changelog:\nWeapons\nLeveler: OPs 10 -> 11, Nerfed the accuracy a bit.\nDarter: Halved the dmg, doubled the burst and ammo. (Seems that the AI is unaware of the onHit effect and was getting overloaded too frequently)\nGraviton Pulser: doubled the ammo regen.\n\nShips:\nEagle prototypes: adjusted all the stats to align with the recent eagle changes.\nGunther: overall stats buff. (LG) version got a phase skimmer system.\nGraff Spee (P): DP 35 -> 30\nTirpitz (LC): changed the System to Micro Burn (Not sure about this change yet, but let us see). Reworked the bultin Hammer, giving it a two stage behavior like a pilum, making it easier to the AI to use.\nadded the Falcon (LG) Prototype, with a large hybrid mount.\n\nHullmods:\nStageone Drive Tunning : removed the penalty to fuel consumption and maintenance cost. Not considered \"Logistics\" anymore.\n\nWings:\nThunderbolts: All of them have limited ammo and a BOMBER behavior now, so they're not so overpowered anymore. Reduced their OP cost to compensate.```\n\n```NOT SAVE COMPATIBLE```\n\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oJNx4EqGqlmgmGXah2gUoRF-Rp_8oR3/view?usp=sharing\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=18938.msg295567#msg295567",

The frigates' DP matches more or less matches their originals' OP cost, and their power is adjusted accordingly. All of the frigates also carry a single wing of their respective fighter type.\n\nYes, this was worth taking the time to translate, why do you ask?\n\nDownload link: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1jie8F3V4oiafjbCANUEQP0zenKPY-EgU\n\nChanges for 1.0.3:\n- A *lot* of balance changes (check the changelog file)\n- Some adjusted variants\n- Updated for 0.97 (obviously)",

      "description": "A very lightweight mod that simply exposes the setting \"CardinalMode\", which, when set to true, enables you to move your ship according to absolute direction rather than relative facing.\n\nSome notes on use:\n* The setting is unfortunately made to override the function of your turn keys, rather than your strafe keys. This means if you want to turn your ship you have no choice but to use the \"shift-aiming\" option.\n* I have noticed that trying to input multiple direction keys at once (e.g. to go NW instead of just N) can result in weirdly inconsistent behavior if you're not facing an absolute direction. I would strongly recommend using this with \"Ship Direction Marker\" by PureTilt.\n\nA big thanks to Genir for making me aware of this setting, which is not documented whatsoever.",

Once you lose 20% of your hull HP, fall below 40% CR, or run out of ammunition, you can turn on autopilot and your ship will navigate to its assigned carrier and land to repair and replenish.\n\nKnown issues:\n-Drift if the landing happens too fast.\n-Fighter Collision class break some weapons that does not target fighters.\n-Refit time is very short if HP is full. (Feature?)\n-~~Unknown result if the carrier retreats with the ship landed inside. Coded for, but untested edge case.~~ \n-ANY docked ship will explode if carrier retreats with ship inside\n-AI pilot doesn't initialize if carrier doesn't have an LPC equipped. 06/18/2021\n\nAll credit goes to Harpuea and all code is theirs\n\nRequires LazyLib\n\nDownload link: https://github.com/CriOwO/Combat-Docking-Module/releases/latest\n\nOriginal mod link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=20415\n\nForum Link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=30297.0",

Built-in on Salvage Rig.\n\nTo prevent hullmod from activating - disable repairs on Salvage Rig or mothball it.\n\n### Improvised Refinery\nInstall an Improvised Refinery onto the ship. The Refinery can inefficiently convert Ore into Metals.\nThe conversion speed is based on CR and number of ships with hullmod within fleet. Having nanoforge in cargo also influences conversion speed and efficiency.\nA logistics hullmod. Can only be installed on Capital class ships. Unlocks when player gets Makeshift Equipment skill. Can be randomly found in derelict structures.\n\nUpdates (effectively) in real-time.\nAlso adds the player ability to toggle refinery on/off.\n\nDM me for bug reports & feedback.\n-# Or if you want to make the currently missing hullmod icons.\n\nBoth mods have LunaLib integration and are safe to add/remove from the ongoing game.\n-# **But please make a separate save before removing or adding mod. This is still BETA...**\n\n**Download:** https://github.com/Heniker/Starsector-Mods/releases",

      "description": "A small mod with a couple of ships and fighters, forged in a volcano and folded a thousand times like a ragged towel.\n\nBalance feedback appreciated!\n\nDownload link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeiPi3OE4QWimBE84HykcyrN1F9OWnir/view?usp=sharing\n\nChangelog:\n```Changes in 1.2.1:\nChanged Petard:\n- speed from 130 to 120\n- refit from 20 to 28\n- OP cost from 15 to 18\n- Greatly reduced the firerate of its launcher.\nThe Petard was intended to be a slow priority target firing slow priority missiles. The firerate used to be high enough to form a barrage of what were essentially slow homing hammers. Now the bomber can be intercepted early (if you actually launch the required firepower at it to take it down) and interrupt the launch. Was also a bit too cheap for what it did.\n\n- Buffed Wasp(P) wing size from 3 to 4.\nThe wing did not have really enough impact in my eyes. Perhaps an extra bomber will help?\n\n- Removed floaters from the Supervisor sprite\nAAAAA\n\n- Fixed some folder capitalisation that caused linux to throw tantrums\n\nTODO: \n\n- Fix Anomaly Curtain AI to only fire when projectiles are headed towards the ship\n- Rebalance Stormsprite because its kinda meh right now\n- Prrrobably look into making the Angst a bit more interesting\n```\nCredits to Nia's Dakkaholics and Trailer Moments for the first banner image.",

      "description": "Ever felt the Sindrian Diktat was too weak as a faction? Then this mod's just the thing for you!\n\nThis mod considerably buffs up the Sindrian Diktat to somewhere between Tri-Tachyon and PL/Hegemony level of size and power. This mod gives them a new system and new markets + lots of other things. Now, they hopefully won't get folded in 2 cycles with Nex enabled, and can even hold their own against the superpowers of the Sector!\n\n*Diktat Enhancement 1.2.2c - no, we’re not back for now, just cleaning up*\n\n**Forum Link**\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22852.0\n\n**Save Compatible**\n\n```\nChanges:\n- Updated to 0.97a-RC11\n- Added unique dialogue to Pride of The Executor’s admiral + minor interaction\n- Fixed NPEs with bringing sierra to Volturnian museum\n- Nerfed and changed Impinge(LG)\n    - 18000 hull -> 17000 hull\n    - 1500 armour -> 1350 armour\n    - 20000 flux -> 17500 flux\n    - 0.9 shield eff -> 1.0 shield eff\n    - Conduit Shroud change: flux removal decays by -5% per use from 25% to 5% with every use\n    - Conduit Shroud desc change(“Activates a barrier that reduces kinetic and HE damage but increasing energy and fragmentation damage. Consumes 25% flux which decays by 5% after every use.”)\n    - Autopulse Carbine change: damage/shot decreased, no longer fires in 50 shot bursts but actually functions more like a normal Pulse Laser with deeper ammo reserves\n```\n\n**Download Below**\nhttps://github.com/Jal85/Diktat-Enhancement/raw/main/Diktat%20Enhancement%201.2.2c.zip",

Customization is done through the mod settings menu\n• Activators: Uses slot shunts to provide the ship with various enhancements by altering the slot they're installed on\n\nSlot Shunt Categories: May be obtained after activating the new ability. These, along with their activators alter the ship in different ways\n• Adapters: Turns a bigger slot into smaller versions (3 large, 1 medium types)\n• Converters: Turns a smaller slot into a bigger one by using slot points (1 medium, 1 small types)\n• Diverters: Turns a slot inactive and yield slot points to be used by above (1 small type)\n• Capacitors: Enhances the total flux capacity of the ship (1 small type)\n• Dissipators: Enhances the total flux dissipation of the ship (1 small type)\n• Launch Tubes: Turns a large slot into a fighter hangar (1 large type)\n\n```ansi\n\u001b[2;32m+ Save compatible; safe to install/update\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2;31m- Cannot be removed; back your save up\u001b[0m\n```\n\nLyra's Releases & Changelogs: [Github](https://github.com/lyravega/lyr_ehm/releases/)\nDependencies: [LunaLib](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25658.0) & [LazyLib](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=5444.0)\nDownload Link: [0.8.7HF](https://files.catbox.moe/nx84js.zip)",

These upgrades do not take OP or hullmod slots! Each ship has a limit to the number of upgrades they can install so choose wisely! The cost of each upgrade will require common materials salvaged across the sector such as metal and transplutonics. However, as upgrades get more complex and specialized, they tend to consume more resources and even demand special items found through research stations and mining stations!\n\nforum link<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29538.msg432789#new>",

Old name portraits are still there for this version (loaded but removed from faction, so they don't generate and can't be selected), but will be removed in the next. It is so people can update mid-save without having npcs and officers suddenly lose their face, but to also filter out the portraits in favour of new names. Hopefully by the time next proper update is in order, people will move on to new saves.\n```",

I'm Lightning Dog and I have one question and *one question only!*\n\n# AI CORES???\n\n\n\nWe here at Lightning Dogs Bad Ideas Emporium have a brand new  product just for you! F-TAPS! \n\nHave you ever wanted to jam an illegally obtained Omega Core into a Radiant to create untold horrors wrought by your hands? Do you want to make an army of alpha core Defenders and start the third AI war?? Would you like to shove the alien mind of a Tesseract inside a Lumen and commit Horrible War Crimes against a Luddic Relief Fleet with the literal incarnation of their devil?\n\nF-TAPS!\n\nOur brand new F-TAPS protocols utilize alien intelligence in little robots to tell the AI points system to go FUCK ITSELF! That's right! Fuck itself! By utilizing a nuclear approach to dealing with an anthill, you too can shove a giant AI core in a capital and have it at full combat Readiness!\n\nOur scientists have called this a \"Terrible Idea\" and a \"Clear cheat mod\" and a \"Violation of ethics\" but I told them that they were FIRED IMMEDIATELY and threw one of them down the stairs!\n\nIs a new mod with new AI cores dodging the effects of a settings altered Quality Captains and still invoking AI points? Fuck them! Shove in our trusty F-TAPS protocols and it'll run like a fresh build! Even if you don't use QC, this can still remove the ever annoying \"balance\" of the AI Points System so you can go to Jangala and commit HIGHLY VISIBLE WAR CRIMES WITH ROBOTS!\n\nDisclaimer: F-TAPS is a cheat mod and disables a full balancing system. Use at your own discretion. Remember, Starsector is a single player game and should be experienced however it is fun to you.",

I plan to stop maintaining the standalone version past 0.97a, so this will likely be the last update for this mod.\n\nFull change log: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/FuelSiphoning/releases>\nDownload: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/FuelSiphoning/releases/latest/download/Fuel.Siphoning.zip>",

      "description": "`Adds 3 factions: the UNSC, the Covenant, and the Ancients.\n\nCOMPATABILITY \n -Is compatible with Nexerelin.\n-NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ORIGINAL OR EXPANDED UNSC MOD.\n\nFEATURES:\nThe Covenant is a high tech and late-game faction to the game to the south east of the core worlds comprising 5 planets. Ships all have high flux cap and dissipation, but Covenant weapon flux usage is correspondingly high, take care when using these weapons on other craft, but have low(ish) armour and hull. EVERYONE HATES THE COVENANT.\nShips have a very high cost, default ships tend to accumulate flux quickly-ish even when firing and not taking damage.\n\nThe UNSC is a midline mid-late game faction northeast of the core worlds comprising 4 planets and 2 stations. Ships all have at least 1 axial ballistic shield-breaking MAC and love missiles and ballistic weapons. Especially hates the Covenant, and has actual relations with other factions unlike the Covenant.\n\nThe Ancients are high-tech and late-game (is there a pattern here?) series of hulls, fighters and weapons. They don't have a faction yet so their ships will spawn with Remnant fleets, albeit with a lower chance.\n\nStations:\nThe UNSC and Covenant have their unique stations that they use, and can be built by the player if` ||your rep with the faction is friendly or better||.\n`\nHULLMODs:\n- Shield with code taken from Star Wars mod (I hope that's ok)\n- Hullmods from original UNSC mod.\n\nAssets taken from UNSC mod by AppleMarineXX and expansion by StargazerRJL mainly for weapons and some Covenant ships.\nSprites taken from Halo wiki and free-to-access artworks on Artstation by Jared Harris (most sprites from here).\nOther sprites made using AI (since I can't art).`\n\n`Download (just requires the most recent one, older vers for those who want it): `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EjgjwhRUI16mDH7XR8maKqCeOUtYLZ0q?usp=drive_link\n`Forum:` https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28804.msg423601#msg423601",

      "description": "Adds more-militarized weapons of pirate mk2 ships, and a couple \"what-if?\" weapons.\nNot balanced and i didn't even attempt.\n```yaml\nShips added:\n- Atlas mk2 (II)\n- Colossus mk3 (II)\n- Mudskipper mk2 (II)\nThey have more armor, more OP and militarized reactors, but very little storage, and less acceleration. They are added as Independent ships, not pirate!\n\nWeapon variants added:\n- Devastator Cannon: version without range issues, version with regenerating charges, and version with both.\n- Hellbore Cannon: proximity shell version (Reaper sized explosion).\n- Plasma Cannon: single shot version.\n- HAG: version that deals less direct damage, but some guaranteed armor damage.\n\nHullmods added:\n- High Spectal Amplifier: same as HSA, but also +100% to all beam PD deapon damage.\n- Auxiliary Ablative Armor: turns ship armor ablative, for a lot of OP. Weaker than Invictus's armor but also isn't quite as weak to AP.\n- Rapid Phase Coils: Feel like Sierra on steroids. x5 speed while phased. x4 phase flux usage. Cruisers and Capitals only.\n- Advanced Weapon Support: +75% damage and +300 range for weapons that go on slots bigger than the weapon.\n```\nDownload: https://github.com/PrincessOfEvil/Independent-Interstellar/archive/refs/tags/0.4.4.zip\nImage:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincessOfEvil/Independent-Interstellar/master/graphics/mudskipper.png",

More new ships, weapons, and expansions to the storyline.

If anyone wants to try this, I would love some feedback on if it makes Starsector run better/worse and if you get stuttering. Message me on here or post it as an issue on Github.\n\n```\nChangelog:\n1.2\n- Initial support files for mac and linux\n1.1\n- Fix for missing opens in vmparams preventing some OSs from saving games.\n1.0 \n- Initial release\n- May stutter without increasing fps in settings.json, increasing fps will use more cpu.\n```\n\nFAQ: \n-Why Java 21? It is the currently released version.\n-Will it work with older javas? It could but not currently.\n-Will it work with newer javas? Untested, but probably until verification is mandatory.\n-Will it work with Linux? Probably? The only thing stopping it would be if the vmparams stuff is different, like a shell script or something. I don't have linux so poke me if it doesn't work out of the box.\n\nInstructions: https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21 \nDownloads:\n https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21/releases/download/1.2/StarsectorJDK21-Windows-1.2.zip\n https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21/releases/download/1.2/StarsectorJDK21-Linux-1.2.zip\n https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21/releases/download/1.2/StarsectorJDK21-Mac-1.2.zip",

It should now be more accessible than ever before.\n\nThis comes with a default template for the Lost Battalion, claiming your past as a domain general overseeing the unfortunate 13th Battlegroup.\n\n**[XIII Ships]**\nThis submod includes 13th Battlegroup ships, sporting high armor, high forward speed, but a steep cost in maneuverability. Also included are a set of converted themed ballistic weaponry focused on extended magazines and themed fighter wings.\n\n**[UI / Fleet Color]**\nChanges the color of the UI, Maroon with orange subcolor.\n\n**[BP/Recovery]**\nRecoverable [Redacted], [Redacted] weapon blueprints, Restored Ziggurat.\n\n**[Merge Disabler]** This is designed so that the player faction file will not be merged with others. If you want a portrait pack to supply portraits to your faction, copy or rename the player.faction file in the portrait pack to playeralt.faction. This should allow you to potentially create player factions with **only** the portraits you want.\n\n\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1xAyTL1ZyZ3ZHdtevkS7g-o2JfBEpnQXS\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25040.msg372026#msg372026",

      "description": "Adds a target leading pip in front of whatever ship you have targeted.\n\nIf you shoot at that pip, you will generally hit the target.  The algorithm takes into account your position and velocity, your target's position and velocity, your weapon group, the positions of the weapons in the weapon group, and the projectile speed of the weapons in the weapon group.  Sometimes the target will be going too quickly to have any hope of hitting it, in which case the reticle may behave oddly, but this is rare.\n\nDownload: https://bitbucket.org/DarkRevenant/leading-pip/downloads/Leading_Pip_1.9.4.7z\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=7921.0",

Hope you like it!\n-Converted Mayasuran Gorgon SRMs into vanilla DEM SRMs.\nThis changes the Crossbow-Class bomber into a new exciting role.\n-Removed Orchard Autoshotgun\nwoopsie, that's a work in progress\n-Changed Carnwennan Railgun damage to 1000 from 600, flux/shot from 800 to 1200\n-Changed Orchard Autocannon damage to 200 from 100, flux/shot from 100 to 200, burst size changed to 2 from 4, OP to 14 from 10\n-Tiger Grenade Launcher refire rate from 0.16 to 0.2, reload size to 10 from 20,\n-Added 'Warm-up' Mechanic to Avenger and Obliterator Rocket Launcher and Heavy UV Pulse Laser.\nBasically, it increases the fire rate the longer you hold the trigger. Giving a very gatling gun feel to the weapons. The base firerate has been decreased however, with the 'warm-up' the fire rate quickly comes back to the original fire rate.\n-Added 'Crit' Mechanic to Ultraviolet Pulse Laser.\nBasically, this has a 20% chance to do double damage on hit. If it's busted, I'ma nerf it but for now... have fun!",

This does not always happen but we suggest you making multiple save to be sure. Since many assistant are seeing rework next patch that will likely fix this issue, and we aren’t able to pin point the cause, there will not be a hot fix for this issue.\n\nSafe to add mid-save but some unique salvage are generated at sector gen and will only be available in a new game.\n\nIf playing with Nexerelin, the randomized sector option will make most assistants unobtainable (it is fine to use Nex, there is a unique start to go with it, just avoid randomized sector)",

      "description": "A collection of quality of life improvements for exploration. Each feature can be individually turned on/off via \nLunaSettings. Can be added to/removed from ongoing campaigns.\nRequires LunaLib and LazyLib.\n\nFeatures:\n\n**Mnemonic Sensors**\nMarks known sensor signatures with a circle, making it easier to identify that a sensor blip is just \na cargo pod full of metal that you left behind rather than some shiny loot or hostile fleet.\n\n**Gate Markers**\nIndicate systems that have a gate with a marker on the star map (when not in Starscape view) to make route-planning easier. Thanks to <@163467166484660224> for the icon sprite!\n\n**Trash Disposal**\nRemoves low-value commodities, such as ore, from the loot screen when your cargo bays are close to full. \nFully customizable via LunaSettings.\n\n**Grid-less system maps**\nRemove the grid from system maps, making it easier to spot things. Feature was pitched and implemented by <@581474784517292037>, many thanks for contributing it to this mod! \n\n**Garage for Rent**\nAdds a bar event to player-owned colonies that lets you store your fleet. While parked, non-quest fleets can't interact with your fleet, you cannot move and supply usage is reduced. This is intended for passing time. Saving while your fleet is parked is not recommended. Thanks to <@705163319736139886> for sponsoring this feature!\n\nPlease provide feedback if you encounter any issues!\n\nFor more details please check the readme: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/mnemonic-sensors?tab=readme-ov-file#mnemonic-utils\n\nDownload: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/mnemonic-sensors/releases",

(feel free to dm me about an issues or sprites)  \n\nI attempted to make the ships balanced but I simply eyeballed the stats based off of vanilla ship stats for the same weight class and sprung from there because I dont have the motivation at the moment to dig into so many different mod folders to find the exact numbers. \nIf anyone wants to volunteer to dig around for this information on your own, i would be very grateful.  \n\nThis update is just a version change, there shouldn't be any reason for a ship pack to break from 0.96 to 0.97, there will be a small content update soon after my midterms end since people have given me sprites that they found that were abandoned",

Hyperstorms will cause these clouds to zap anyone who draws near them, periodically, with a very powerful EMP bolt.\nBlack Holes: Drags all entities in combat towards the black hole, and increases time dilation of all ships.\nPulsars: Pushes all entities in combat away from the pulsar, reduces shield stats (efficiency, more upkeep, emp arc pierce chance), slowly generates hardflux, randomly EMPs ships, and charges all projectiles with a flat bonus to EMP damage.\nMeson Field (More Planetary Conditions): Normally increases non-missile weapon range and vision range by a moderate amount, but in storms significantly increases all weapon range, wing range, system range, and vision range.```\n\n**Safe to add and remove from saves.**\n\nDownload: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/releases\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/tree/master\nForum thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25567.0\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1204273543408521296/1248010288557588510/Capture.PNG?ex=66656767&is=666415e7&hm=24cea2c2e1e169656bbd10bdb2ecb55a6183ea94415443dab30deec2bb2c86c8&",

Fixed crash due to arcade/simulation having no music.\nv0.9: 14/04/2024-Added (a lot of) combat music, trimmed existing music, rewrote code.\nv0.1b: 27/03/2024-You don't need to download unless you want to change player faction music into a non-vanilla faction using Nexerelin's music option(Fixed compatibility) Also added a readme file & Changed the menu icon.\nv0.1a: 21/03/2024-Fixed crash upon arriving at dead-drop target location due to having no music\nv0.1: 21/03/2024-New Mod Created\n```\n[Download](https://github.com/zman406986/MusicSwitcher/releases/latest/download/MusicSwitcher.zip)\n[Forum Thread](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29440)",

      "description": "An overhaul of fuel economy that makes resource management and survival an integral part of exploration.\nThis mod is essentially an alternate version of Nomadic Survival with different default settings and a few additions.\n\nPerilous Expanse makes the sector seem much larger. Not by increasing distances and travel times, but by making it necessary to find ways to refuel during long expeditions. It drastically limits how far you can travel without refueling, but it also provides several new ways to obtain fuel. This makes expeditions to distant stars a matter of careful planning or clever improvisation rather than just bringing more fuel tankers. Several parts of the map may even seem unreachable until you unlock new abilities, learn new tricks, discover helpful artifacts, or figure out new ways to craft fuel.\n\nFull description: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29047.0>\n\nLatest changes:\n```fix\n- Fixed a rare issue that could result in stations being deleted under unknown circumstances\n```\n\nFull change log: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases> (shared with Nomadic Survival)\nDownload: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases/latest/download/Perilous.Expanse.zip>",

      "description": "A semi-continuation of Modern Carriers\n\nWhat's gone: Concord, and with it: Dynamic Manufactory, PD Drone Deployment, Fighter Bay Standardization, Autopilot Interface, The core that converts all fighters into support fighters, Oversized Manufactory.\n\nWhat's back: Flux Quantum Entanglement, Burnout Reactor, and Bastion Core.\n\nWhat's new: Lunalib dependence. Overhauled logic for the fighter auto-dock mechanic - fighters no longer have to be set to regroup to dock once damaged; crewed fighters will always return when the hull thresholds are crossed; crewless fighters fight to the death when not manually regrouped - This \"Fearless\" drone behavior can be turned off in Lunaconfig. If you want to disable the auto-dock stuff entirely set all of the sliders to 0. Lunaconfig options to set the thresholds for the 'conservative deployment' hullmod, and the ability to customize how quick to redock for repairs fighters are based off of their refit time (categories are <=5 seconds, <=15 seconds, and >15 seconds). \n\nAlso, there is a currently WIP option in Lunaconfig to have fighters automatically redock when half of the carrier's fighters are dead or already regrouping. Works fine but it causes fighters and interceptors to retreat automatically quite often if they're mixed together with bombers (and the bombers represent half of the carrier's 'fighters') since the bombers count as regrouping when they finish their bombing run. I haven't decided on how I want to handle this yet.\n\n\nWhat's unchanged: Everything not already mentioned.\n\nI mostly updated this mod for the sake of the fighter redocking stuff. That is to say - don't get your hopes up regarding the lost concord dependent features.\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=31038.0",

Or, this being a beta and my brain being fried on a Sunday night, it will crash your game.\n- Maybe other stuff?

      "description": "**A gameplay-first, balance friendly, completely configurable skill overhaul.** \nQC brings QOL features, meaningful choices, and more than 300 options to tweak the game to perfection. \nEvery skill has been carefully curated for the the best features from every game version. Most skills are more flexible than before, designed to benefit every ship and excel on specialized craft. \n- Every skill is balanced against all the others and the choices you make will be based on how you want to play.\n- Skills don't change their power based on your fleet size\n- Also makes ECM and Navigation battle effects way more fun.\nV1.5 introduced a **perk system** with milestones that your character automatically unlocks as they progress through the story. These milestones include powerful QOL features and most of the effects are completely fresh to the modiverse. \n\nV1.6 incorporates a few of the latest skill effects in 0.97, but the best part is **none of the +/- raw damage effects** are included. Enjoy Starsector at its **best**, with the full texture of the game. \n\n**Enjoy!

Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nConqueror- Midline battleship, fast but very poor rear arcs.  Comes with 2 fighter bays.\nJavelin- Midline cruiser with AAF.  Main armament is 4 medium ballistics.\nPolaris- Midline battlecarrier with reloading Harpoon launchers.\nViper- Midline frigate with AAF.\nBarrage-Capital ship made out of station parts.  Slow, but heavy firepower.\n\nDevastation- Large slot HE ballistic weapon.   Will show up in mercenary fleets occasionally.\nMjolnir Heavy Cannon- Triple-barrel Mjolnir, good luck finding something with the flux to use this well. \nAutopulse Beam- Designed as a shitpost, is just an Autopulse Laser that was turned into a beam weapon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nPlasma Beam- Similar to the Autopulse Beam, but based on the Plasma Cannon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nTachyon Accelerator- Projectile variant of Tachyon Lance.  Does not pierce shields.  \nLight Mjolnir- Single-barrel Mjolnir, fits in medium slots.\nHeavy Positron Cannon- Hybrid large weapon.  Probably needs more balancing.\nPiledriver Heavy Railcannon- Large kinetic ballistic. \nHarpoon Missile Battery-Large slot Harpoon launcher.\n\nCan be added mid-playthrough and should function correctly if done.\n\n\nKnown issues:\n-Due to Persean League doctrine, the Egret will rarely spawn in faction stores.\n-The Onslaught variant is terribly balanced.  This is fine. \n-Sounds for the beam weapons are terrible.  Will be fixed in a future release.\n\nForum link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28822.0\n\n```Changelog:\n0.0.5\nAdded the Tachyon Accelerator, a large slot energy weapon similar to the Tachyon Lance.

That's because they belong to a category your fleets need and might not have have an alternative for. (Shuttles, tankers, cargo ships, combat freighters, etc.)\n\nSafe to remove from your save*. ~~The game will load the value from default player faction file (which is to say, no actual value at all, putting these ships on even footing with all other blueprints).~~",

      "description": "Do you have a chronic mod addiction that makes the list ships command produce several pages of console output? Do you like testing out ideas for fleets but hate flicking though the variant editor for 5 minutes straight adding smods?  I do, and I have spent hours automating parts of these minor inconveniences.\n\nSome commands include:\n\n**ShipBrowser**\nOpens a gui ship browser that's organised by mod and ship class. The gui opens after the console is closed.\n\n**CloneShip <shipNumber> [numberOfClones]**\nCreates a copy of a specified ship in the player fleet. \"shipNumber\" is the order that ships appear in the refit screen. For example the fifth ship from the top in the refit sceen would be ship number 5. \"numberOfClones\" is a number that defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\n**FindSystemsWithTags <manditory1stTag> [optionalAdditionalTags]**\nList the star systems with all of the tags specified in the arguments. A list of tags can be found in com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.ids.Tags of the StarSector API. Input the string that corresponds to the tag obtained by viewing Constant Field Values. Can be used to find hypershunts and remnants\n\n**AddDMods <shipSelection> <numDmods>**\nAdds \"numDmods\" dmods to the ships specified by \"shipSelection\". \"NumDmods\" is a number. \"shipSelection\" can be a number (eg. 5), a range (eg, 5-10) or the word all. The numbers in \"ShipSelection\"  corresponds to the order ships appears in the fleet or refit screen. For example the fifth ship in the refit screen is ship 5.\n\nA full list of commands can be found on the forum post. Note that some of the fleet editing commands don't work while the refit screen is open for some reason. No clue why\n\nDownload: https://github.com/itBeABruhmoment/ShipBrowser/releases/download/1.2/ShipBrowser1.2.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=26261.msg390257#msg390257",

Controls are fully customizable.\n\nEver wish the game would go by quicker while you're flying your lumbering Paragon up to the line of battle?  Ever wanted to push \"fast forward\" while your fleet mopped up the remnants of an enemy fleet?  Ever wanted to speed through a trivial Derelicts fight?  This mod is for you!\n\nYou can also press the caps lock key to toggle fast mode at your leisure.  The B button toggles the slow-down effect of phase systems.  Control-capslock toggles the game to run in as-fast-as-possible mode.  You can even set custom time scaling factors on separate inputs, if you like.\n\nDownload: https://bitbucket.org/DarkRevenant/speedup/downloads/SpeedUp_1.0.1.7z\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13394.0",

While not as expansive as hullmods, this collection will still make stations just a bit more engaging.\n\nAugments can be find by salvaging, and are an uncommon find. They do NOT dilute the loot pool, instead adding more loot in total. Augments can also be obtained by destroying a station with augments.\nAugments are also applied to NPC markets (Currently, theyre manually placed via modsettings).\n\nThe entire augment system was designed with other mods in mind, meaning other mods can create their own augments and apply augments to their own markets without a hard dependency.\n\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=30583.0\nDownload: *Download link removed due to instability*\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/Station-Augments",

Lots of ballistic, hybrid, and energy hardpoints splattered throughout ~6 rough categories of ships.  Generally being pretty strong and good quality if bought from the faction but appropriately expensive.   \n\nIs almost complete, it only needs the ship and system descriptions written which I'd like to do after someone other than me's played with these ships to hopefully get more fitting descriptions.\nFeedback is not only appreciated but highly encouraged, please ping me in the appropriate channel or dm me with any comments or complaints (I'm mostly interested in collecting opinions on the ships doe ngl)\n\n```Changelog:\n1.0.0\nAdded - Mod\nRemoved - Herobrine```\n\nDownload: https://discord.com/channels/187635036525166592/1267608001255047229/1270449359053656136",

Before this, they were a large mercenary band working for the independents league. As their power grew, they begin to settle systems they have discovered by chance, and through integration of their survey findings ands technologies of various worlds, they built their worlds into a real fortress. From there, they built an association formed by other Traversers and like-minded individuals. A core institution called [Traverser Design Bureau] guide this faction forward. As an extremely xenophilic faction, they are welcoming and warm, but also bound by strict regulations. As long as you follow their laws, they will welcome your arrival. \n\nWhat can be certain is that the association is providing special warships and weapons to reputable clients. \n\n**Faction Feature**\nMost ship have fairly strong shield resistance with weaker armor. They focus on Missile Strike and Carrier Strike. Now, you can modify their built in basic hull mods to further change their fighting style in a flexible manner.\n\nAdds a faction with their own unique line of ships and support drone ships, together with a series of weapons and hull mods, as well as a few minor quest line.",

      "description": "## New game cycle\n\n1. This mod to some extent makes up for the position of the previous old mod, SaveTransfer. When a player reaches the max level, he/she can record a saving point through the UNGP menu (there is only one saving point in all saves, which could be overwritten). The saving point will save your current credits, blueprints (other than the factory), and the current game cycle number (the new save's game cycle number will be \"1\").\n2. After that, you can start a new game. If you open the UNGP menu within 1 day, you can inherit the saving point, basing on the background you choose, inherit 0~100% of the credits and blueprints , and get extra bonus like skills, skill points and story points.\n\n## Specialist Mode\n\n1. From the second gamecycle, players can choose to enter the Specialist Mode.\n2. The specialist mode is divided into 4 levels: Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Omega.\n3. The selection rules have a maximum number of rules, which increases with the specialist difficulty level.\n4. Specialist mode offers two types of rules: positive rules and negative rules.\nPositive rules: consume Cost points and provide you with different benefits for the rest of the game.\nNegative rules: providing Cost points to add heavy obstacles to your game\nSpecialist mode can only be enabled if the total number of Cost points is greater than or equal to 0 and the number of rules is greater than the specified value.\n5. Specialist mode can change rules once a year, once in the beginning by default. However, the specialist level could not be changed during the game.\n\n## Links\n\nDownload:<https://github.com/TruthOriginem/UNGP/releases/download/2.3.0-hotfix/UNGP_2.3.0.zip>\nForum:<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=16680.0>\nSource:<https://github.com/TruthOriginem/UNGP>",

      "description": "Add a mid-tech battle group. Having some vanilla-like ships. Having some special faction weapons, but all of these are build-in their ships. \n\nStarsector Mod by Yisic/Diling\nProofread by Mycophobia\n\nRequires Graphic Lib/Lazy Lib/Magic Lib/Nex\n\n```Lore```\nXXVII - Shakeles Garrison\nShackles Garrison is comprised of the remnants of the XXVII Battlegroup, disillusioned with human rule after being left adrift for an extended period of time after the Collapse, seeing themselves as abandoned by the rest of humanity. Their arrival in the Sector was originally marked by a willingness to collaborate, but the geopolitically volatile environment of the Sector caused them to be embroiled in significant conflict with both Tri-Tachyon Technology and the Hegemony. These conflicts resulted in the annihilation of the Garrison's capital planet and significant fleet losses, forcing the faction to retreat to a small star system outside of the Core Worlds.\n\nThe net effect of these conflicts was to transform the Shackles Garrison from a disillusioned, somewhat cynical, but fundamentally collaborative faction with a decently-sized military force into a civilization driven almost exclusively by revenge. Specifically, a cold, patient, seething determination to exact vengeance on those who ultimately killed billions of their people, after they had arrived in the Sector with cooperative intentions. For now, they were weak, beaten, unthreatening - but they would bide their time, marshal their forces, sharpen their blades - and then there would be hell to pay.\n\nIt will be better if you start your new run after you finish all XXVII missions. Because those missions will give you some reward. \n\n``Newest Ver is: v0.9.7\n``\n```Download```\nGithub(English version): https://github.com/dilinganye/XXVIIBattleGroup_EN/releases/tag/Shakeles_Garrsion\n\nIf that one can't working, try this below (a really old version) -\nhttps://mega.nz/file/h9oi1I7B#87g-9PFxv1fB9o4dvk5PV6oyLWZb0_nsJR01F5jc8SU",

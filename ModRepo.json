Ping someone who looks active before pinging all, please.\n- Include the mod name, a short description, the version, and the download link.\n- Include a changelog, whether it is ok to add to an existing save, whether the update is save-compatible, a forum link, source code link, and an image.\n- Keep the post reasonably short. Use only highlights from a changelog and pare down the description.\n- Add an image/gif to showcase your mod; it will make people more likely to download it if they can see what they're getting into.\n- Compress your mod to a `.zip` (recommended because of native support on all systems) and host it somewhere (GitHub, BitBucket, GDrive, Patreon, etc).\n- Tip: write in a text editor instead of Discord to avoid accidental sending/deletion, then copy/paste to Discord.\n- Tip: when adding a new version, edit your old post, copy it, then paste it and modify it to make the new post.\n- Tip: wrapping a link with `<` and `>` will tell Discord not to attach a link preview.\n\nSuggested Starter Template\n```\n__**Onslaught of Onslaughts 1.0.0**__\nAdds 200 Onslaught reskins and over 500 Onslaught-related loading screen tips.\nSafe to add to saves and safe to update on the same save (save-compatible).\n\n\\`\\`\\` (without the 3 \\, only the `)\nAdded\n- 10 more Onslaught reskins\n\nModified\n- Phase-slaughts now use mine system.\n\nFixed\n- Switched on Offslaught.\n\\`\\`\\`\n\ndownload: <https://example.com/onslaught-of-onslaughts-1.0.0.zip>\nforum: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=00000>\nsource code: <https://github.com/example/ooo>\n```",

For each weapon group, you can select a fire mode (e.g. AvoidShields) and a suffix (e.g. HoldFire when Flux > 75%) to customise how that group should behave. Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux > 50%) and a ~~badly~~ expertly done GUI.\nCan be added/removed to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\nRelevant new features in 0.11.0: Lots of bugfixes for the custom targeting AI, rework of target/avoidShields modes (now consider shield flanking)\n\nNew features in 0.12.0: GUI polish, ability to load suggested weapon modes. \nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: You can now add suggested modes/suffixes for your weapons in modSettings.json (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/devel2/data/config/modSettings.json for an example)\n\nFeedback is much appreciated, especially on the pre-release version.\nThanks and happy gaming/modding!",

      "description": "**Apex Design Collective 1.0.5**\n\nManaged to tear myself away from other games to update this.\n\nSave compatible, even if added to an existing save- the systems and faction will be automatically generated.\n```Ships:\n- Komodo: System changed to Entropy Consolidator. Speed increased to 45.\n- Caiman: System changed to Entropy Consolidator. Speed increased to 85.\n- Entropy Consolidator: Acts like a normal damper field, but generates (interceptable) homing energy projectiles based on incoming damage.\nWeapons:\n- Fusion Beams (all sizes): Now requires 0.5 seconds of uninterrupted armor damage to trigger the explosion.\n- Nanoacid Cannons (all sizes): Slightly improved efficiency; increased projectile velocity.\n- Inversion Beam: Improved EMP damage and arc rate.\nHullmods:\n- Coherency Amplifier: Fixed an issue where flak QGPD shots could deal energy damage to the same target multiple times.\n- Geodesic Shield Matrix: Reworked, simplified, and nerfed. Now transfers a flat amount of damage from each hit to armor. Reduced the unfolding rate bonus to 50%. Also works on beams now.```\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22704.0\nDownload: https://github.com/theDragn/ApexDesignCollective/releases/download/1.0.0/Apex.Design.Collective_1.0.5.zip",

(Thanks to Coherrent Watermelon for the base sprite)\n\nSprite Changes:\nHammerhead (LP) sprite updated to match new Hammerhead sprite better.\nTerringzean sprite changes again.\nStern completely resprited. No longer resembles a squashed Hammerhead. (Thanks to Passwalker for some sprite ideas)\nCassina has had its sprite changed a bit, more colour variation.\n\nBalance Changes\nFixed Cassina Weapon arcs.\nTerringzean now has Heavy Ballistic Integration. Slightly increased speed and slightly increased max flux, base dissipation and hull points. Should make it a more capable capital and easier to outfit. 56DP instead of 60DP now too.\nRestitution Torp nerfed a bit, now does 1750 damage and has 210 speed, EMP damage 500 but its EMP effect now arcs.\nShalloch has been nerfed, was too powerful and came with too many free hull mods\nStern has one less small, actually helps manage its small flux pool.\n\nBSC Drone Submod: removed white stripes from drones, making them pure blue to better match other high tech ships. Added Merlon (LC)`\n\nSave Compatible with 0.1.9 and 0.1.8.5b\n\nDownload link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asq8VveyY9vTMslEK9YllFA_KPnpy0sc/view?usp=sharing\nDownload for Drone Submod: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0MLCKtSA4BSWjM0Di1kP_FrRBfZHYgw/view?usp=sharing\nForum Link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21358.0",

I'll be working on something else for a while though, so no promises on getting things done today/tomorrow.\nI'll put out a version that swaps the white and navy (i.e. a rough recreation of the previous ornate skinpack) at some point soonish.

The main purpose of this mod is a performance boost, taking advantage of modern GPU horsepower. The increase is found through removing CPU load and transferring it to the GPU, which vanilla starsector does not take advantage tremendously.\n\nRequires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3\n\n```\nv1.1.0\n-updated shader code to optimised versions from Jon Micheelsen\n-tweaked glow visuals\n-fixed bugs with system activated engines for good hopefully\n-reload engine data with F8\n-fixed bug with force override setting```\n\nFeatures:\n> Replace SHIP (and fighter) engine plumes and glows with a fast instanced renderer. Moderate testing suggests a ~25% increase in performance in large battles with many fighter/ships, your mileage may vary.\n> Crisp 😩 👌 and smooth engine visual\n\nCaveats:\n> Does not affect missile engines, they will still use vanilla behaviour. Engine colour changing has been implemented for Safety Overrides, Plasma Jets and Plasma Burn, however any other modded effects will not take effect because it is hardcoded, this is not fixable unfortunately.\n**Download:** https://github.com/automatopaste/fast-engine-rendering/releases/download/v1.1.0/FastEngineRendering_v1.1.0.zip",

Brought to you lovingly after a week of testing.\n\n```\nPacks Included:\n- JRE7 Safe Pack\n- JRE8 Safe/Aggresive/Dangerous Pack\n- For 1/2/3/4/6/8GB\n- G1GC Hide Leak Messages mods\n```\n\nKey differences between packs\nAll share the same trait of having a low latency multi-threaded GC (the janitor you may call it) to reclaim unused memory and make the game smooth. For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who're curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn't launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you're using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

Ed.)**\n\nTo some the GMDA is a Robin Hood-like police organisation, stealing from the established factions and giving it to the low-down independent-leaning folks across the sector. To others, they are an exploitative mafia who reave established factions and hiding behind their false image in independent ports. Regardless of the truth, the GMDA is a persistent and annoying threat to the faction merchant, and one that disappears when stronger foes appear.\n\nChangelog\n0.9.8a\n-Added GM Health Service ships, that boost marines, reduce crew loss across the fleet, and use obscene defense shuttles.\n-Mudskipper (GMHS), Nebula (GMHS) and Starliner (GMHS).\n\n-Added GM Fire Service ships, that help salvage and speed up repairs, and are supported by strange defense fighters.\n-Shepherd (GMFS), Gemini (GMFS) and Mora (GMFS).\n-Also added GMFS weapons -  they're strange, and niche, and weird, and possibly powerful when used correctly.\n\n-Bluebottler gun is no longer a weak EMP stream weapon, it's now like a small MG thumper\n\n-Updated to 0.95.1a\n\nSavegame compatible *with previous version*, otherwise not savegame compatible.\n\nDownload here:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/GrytpypeMoriarty_0_9_8a.zip",

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.3 Changes*\n\n-Fang Society now uses ~~the Luddic Experimental~~ a completely new and novel Damper Field system as a replacement for their shield; their hullmods now give less armour and less hull to compensate.\n-Draco Group now possesses a passive EMP arc system that zaps nearby enemies, with the zapping rate increasing with rising flux. Shields now take more damage, and the range clamp to 600 units is now more severe to compensate.\n-Fang and Draco now have rudimentary Nexerellin starting options\n\n*0.0.3a*\n-Fixed the Fang CTD\n-Fixed the Draco EMP hitting friendly missiles\n\n*Savegame Compatible*\n\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_3a.zip",

      "description": "**MOSS (Mod Organizer for StarSector) 0.6.2**\n*Formerly known as Starsector Mod Manager*\n\n**Features:**\n- Batch mod installation (no fiddling with nested mods either)\n  - Supports all major archive types: zip, rar, 7z, tar\n- Version checking out of game\n- One click mod updates (aka: mod auto-updates)\n- Mod x Starsector compatibility checks\n- VMParams editor (Windows only)\n- Direct launch (optionally bypassing vanilla launcher)\n- Local mod search\n- Install stats\n- Duplicate mod install detection\n\n**_Now fixed to not bug you about updating every time..._**\n\nThis release primarily addresses the fact that whilst I did fix one bug in the previous release (overwrites resulting in duplicates) I also introduced a bug where overwrites were never actually performed.... That's fixed now. I also added tooltips, so now you'll actually know what the version of the available update is - and what the pretty colours actually mean.\n\n- **New:**\n  - Version information tooltips\n    - Tooltips appear when you hover over the icons in the `Version` column\n    - Tooltips detail what type of update is available (`Major`, `Minor`, etc) and the version number of the update\n- **Fixed:**\n  - Selecting \"overwrite\" in the update/overwrite dialogue should now correctly perform an overwrite\n  - There were some other cases where a similar issue was present, but I hadn't had reports/actually reproduced them myself\n\n**Notable Previous Changes:**\n- **New**\n  - Duplicate mod detection\n    - Presents a new modal window when duplicate mod installs are detected\n    - The modal will include a list of all known duplicate mods. \n    - Each entry will present details about the duplicates, including their version, path, last modification date and creation date\n  - Overwrite requests are now grouped into a single window, preventing new window spam when updating many mods at once\n    - You may need to scroll the window to view all updates/conflicts, but \"Overwrite All\" and \"Cancel All\" are provided for convenience\n- **Fixes**\n  - All modals (logs, overwrite requests, etc) now scroll their contents instead of it going out of view\n  - Updates/overwrites now preserve enable state in the UI (enable state was still set correctly in enabled.json)\n\n||To download, open the `Download` link, then open the assets folder/accordion/thing and pick your platform||\n\n**Download**: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust/releases/tag/0.6.2>\n**Sources**: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust>\n**Forum**: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21995.0>",

It contains a singular fighter bay and a Targetting Uplink.\n> The Dart is a light Destroyer, focusing on defenses over offensive capabilities.\n> The Corkscrew Destroyer is a missile boat, using vertically aligned missile hardpoints to bring the equivalent of roughly 9 small missile weapons and 1.5 medium missile weapons to bear. Additionally, its Fast Missile Racks allows it to deploy a large amount of ordinance in a short time.\n> The Saint, in contrast to the Corkscrew, is a Destroyer with much less numerous armaments, possessing only two large missile hardpoints, two medium ballistic turret mounts, and four small ballistic turret mounts. However with it's limited Missile Autoforge system, it is capable of providing support indefinitely for all but the longest of combats.\n> The Armadillo Cruiser, like the Dart, favours durability over offense. While said to be undergunned by most, they serve as a decent distraction, being not quite undergunned enough to ignore.\n> The Collumbus Cruiser is the little brother to the Conquest, possessing much the same armaments, but in lesser number and on a lighter, faster frame.\n> The Ptero Capital Ship is built around a singular concept: Missile saturation. It's already formidable loadout of four medium missile hardpoints and one large missile hardpoint is further augmented by an unrestricted Missile Autoforge system.\n> The Spear of Persea is designed to pierce enemy battle lines, the Spear is capable of effectively engaging with both broadsides simultaneously.\n\n***Changelog:***\n> Added the Saint-class Destroyer.\n> Reworked the Spear of Persea to make it more Midline.\n> Made the Spear of Persea's quests more accessible.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

Totally didn't just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I'm not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn't not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts. The only exception is the Lion Guard Falcon, which is about as common as the Lion Guard Eagle from the base SWP mod. Let me know if any ship seems to be spawning too much or too little.\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**\nThis mod requires Ship/Weapon Pack to work!\n\nAdded download link after posting because am stupid:\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24151.0",

It's possible, for example, to have up to three Radiants in your fleet without suffering any CR maluses. The drawback is an increase in the amount monthly supplies required to keep your ships operational. You'll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I'm open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.1 changelog\n```\n- Fixed compatibility issue with Seeker (TAS now only affects ships in the player's fleet)\n```\n\nv1.2 changelog:\n```\n- Updated values and calculations to adapt to patch 0.95.1a-RC6\n- Added a modifier to AP reduction based on hull size (sorry, running 12 Radiants per fleet would've been a bit too much)\n- Added settings file for customisation\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

Beware, that the projectile is slow, and the weapon can only fire once every 6 seconds.\n> Added the Downscaled High Intensity Laser, a medium version of the HIL that only does 180 damage.\n> Added the Graviton PD, a small energy projectile weapon that pushes fighters and missiles away in addition to doing damage.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

While slow and weakly armoured, it does possess a basic shield, and a Phase Skinner for both defense and mobility.\n> The Sphyrnidae-class Cruiser focuses on close-range brawling. A combination of a Flux Shunt and Unstable Containment Fields lets the Sphyrnidae excel despite the normal weaknesses associated with a shield-focused ship at close quarters.\n\n> The Steve-class frieghter is a more armoured version of the Buffalo, designed for a more hostile sector. A Burn Drive and Damper Field allows it to escape pursuit when needed, while a shielded cargo hold helps avert attacks in the first place.\n> The Tiwaz-class Capital is the little brother to the Onslaught. While it lacks the signature Thermal Pulse Cannons, it possesses a higher level of integration than most ships in existence.\n> The Offensive-class Onslaught, in contrast, is a bigger, beefier Onslaught. Much of its bulk is dedicated to its pair of Thermal Pulse Accelerators, allowing it to fire faster and hit harder. It's ship system also received adjustments, being replaced with Manuevering Jets to bring its main weapons on-target quicker.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

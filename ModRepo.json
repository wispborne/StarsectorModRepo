Mods using this are Exotica Technologies, Random Assorted Things, and Apex Design Collective. If you're a mod author and I missed your mod, let me know.\n\nChangelog:\n```\nv1.3.0 - bunch of fixes for stuff that wasn't quite right: drone movement and rotation, hotkeys assigning, and also added some new overridable methods and a new base class to help mods integrate this library.\nv1.1.2 - drone activators now spawn all drones at start of combat without consuming charges. this means they'll start with full charges, which (iirc) is the same as drone systems in vanilla.\nv1.1.1 - ship timeflow mult is now taken into account when advancing activators\nv1.1.0 - added drone activators\n```\n\n**Download:** https://github.com/scardwell15/combatactivators/releases/download/v1.3.0/Combat-Activators-v1.3.0.zip\n\nDonations are appreciated. \nhttps://ko-fi.com/presidentmattdamon",

Fielded exclusively by the Church to bolster their lines with LIDAR-boosted long-range barrages. Slow, but capable of battering enemies before they can even think of fighting back.\n- Added the Mothman-class phase cruiser. A heavy composite-component craft exclusively assembled at Kapteyn Starworks, featuring a vast ballistics-focused frontal battery supplemented by torpedoes and the ability to deploy phase-barriers. \n- Added the Minesweeper-class frigate. A small weapon platform specialized in point-defense escort duty.\n- Added the Petard-class heavy bomber. An incredibly dangerous pirate bomber corvette that lugs four heavy guided fuel bombs to its target.\n- Added the Wasp (P) class bomber. Fast and more fragile than the actual payload itself, pirate-modified Wasps are disposable in every way possible.\n- A bunch of uh, stat tweaks to some existing content that I forgot to properly log. Vanguard-Orion, Herbert and Angst are a bit tankier, Stormsprite is a bit less silly.\n```\nCredits to Nia's Dakkaholics and Trailer Moments for the first banner image. I, uh, couldn't be bothered to turn it off, and the Hellbore sprite just looks several times better than the vanilla one anyway.",

Now, they hopefully won't get folded in 2 cycles with Nex enabled, and can even hold their own against the superpowers of the Sector!\n\n*Diktat Enhancement 1.2.2b - quick and dirty hot fix + various changes*\n\n**Forum Link**\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22852.0\n\n**Probably not save compatible due to Gamaliel changes**\n\n```\nChanges:\n- Updated to 0.97a\n- Buffed Bretasinge(LG)\n- Changed most descs of ships to make their functions clearer\n- Changed desc of Farnau because apparently blue supergiants are not degenerate or smth\n- Changed Medium Missile Turrets on Impinge(LG) to Hardpoints\n- Finished the description of the Legate as it was apparently unfinished\n- Resprited the Gamaliel and changed its basically everything\n```\n\n**Download Below**\nhttps://github.com/Jal85/Diktat-Enhancement/raw/main/Diktat%20Enhancement%201.2.2b.zip",

Ships all have high flux cap and dissipation, but Covenant weapon flux usage is correspondingly high, take care when using these weapons on other craft, but have low(ish) armour and hull. EVERYONE HATES THE COVENANT.\nShips have a very high cost, default ships tend to accumulate flux quickly-ish even when firing and not taking damage.\n\nThe UNSC is a midline mid-late game faction northeast of the core worlds comprising 3 planets. Ships all have at least 1 axial ballistic shield-breaking MAC and love missiles and ballistic weapons. Especially hates the Covenant, and has actual relations with other factions unlike the Covenant.\n\nThe Ancients are high-tech and late-game (is there a pattern here?) series of hulls, fighters and weapons. They don't have a faction yet so their ships will spawn with Remnant fleets, albeit with a lower chance.\n\nHULLMODs:\n- Shield with code taken from Star Wars mod (I hope that's ok)\n- Hullmods from original UNSC mod.\n\nAssets taken from UNSC mod by AppleMarineXX and expansion by StargazerRJL mainly for weapons and some Covenant ships.\nSprites taken from Halo wiki and free-to-access artworks on Artstation by Jared Harris (most sprites from here).\nOther sprites made using AI (since I can't art).\n\nHardpoint sprites will be added once ships are more balanced (and possibly downsized).\n\nDownload (just requires the most recent one, older vers for those who want it): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EjgjwhRUI16mDH7XR8maKqCeOUtYLZ0q?usp=drive_link\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28804.msg423601#msg423601",

They are added as Independent ships, not pirate!\n\nWeapon variants added:\n- Devastator Cannon: version without range issues, version with regenerating charges, and version with both.\n- Hellbore Cannon: proximity shell version (Reaper sized explosion).\n- Plasma Cannon: single shot version.\n- HAG: version that deals less direct damage, but some guaranteed armor damage.\n\nHullmods added:\n- High Spectal Amplifier: same as HSA, but also +100% to all beam PD deapon damage.\n- Auxiliary Ablative Armor: turns ship armor ablative, for a lot of OP. Weaker than Invictus's armor but also isn't quite as weak to AP.\n- Rapid Phase Coils: Feel like Sierra on steroids. x5 speed while phased. x4 phase flux usage. Cruisers and Capitals only.\n- Advanced Weapon Support: +75% damage and +300 range for weapons that go on slots bigger than the weapon.\n```\nDownload: https://github.com/PrincessOfEvil/Independent-Interstellar/archive/refs/tags/0.4.3.zip\nImage:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincessOfEvil/Independent-Interstellar/master/graphics/mudskipper.png",

Would you, maybe, just maybe, like to give that Onslaught (XIV) Manjets on top of it's burn drive? NOW YOU CAN!\n\nIncludes four hullmods that take colony items and a considerable chunk of your ship's OP to make it a monster. Currently Included are The Starkiller/Overlord Flux Jets Overhaul hullmods, safety overrides on crack that also paste Plasma Jets/Manjets onto your small ships/large ships, respectively; the Iron Collar Armor System, an armor ovehaul and shield shunt stuck through a Pristine Nanoforge to make the largest slab of steel you've ever seen, and the Hexchain Electronic Warfare Network, where you sacrifice an Alpha Core to the ECM/Missile mines.\n\nMore may pop up when I figure out how I want to super a Carrier and a Shield Ship.\n\nMod commissioned from Mayu; they did all the work and are *big cool every time.*",

      "description": "REQUIRES LAZYLIB, LUNALIB\n\nAdds custom combat effects to all terrain that did not have an effect previously, and spruces up the rest.\nCurrently implemented:\n```Magnetic field - Reduces weapon range, fighter range, missile maneuverability/guidance, vision range, and adds a small chance for missiles to have guidance scrambled.\nSlipstream - Force SO on all ships, fighters, and MISSILES, (venting allowed but with reduced effectiveness, for things like excelsior), slowly passively generate hardflux.\nNebula (DISABLED BY DEFAULT): Nebula clouds reduce weapon range, vision, speed, and disable zero-flux boost while inside of them.\nDeep hyperspace: Spawn nebula clouds. Hyperstorms will cause these clouds to zap anyone who draws near them, periodically, with a very powerful EMP bolt.\nBlack Holes: Drags all entities in combat towards the black hole, and increases time dilation of all ships.\nPulsars: Pushes all entities in combat away from the pulsar, reduces shield stats (efficiency, more upkeep, emp arc pierce chance), slowly generates hardflux, randomly EMPs ships, and charges all projectiles with a flat bonus to EMP damage.```\n\n**Safe to add and remove from saves.**\n\nDownload: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/releases\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/tree/master\nForum thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25567.0",

      "description": "An overhaul of fuel economy that makes resource management and survival an integral part of exploration.\nThis mod is essentially an alternate version of Nomadic Survival with different default settings and a few additions.\n\nPerilous Expanse makes the sector seem much larger. Not by increasing distances and travel times, but by making it necessary to find ways to refuel during long expeditions. It drastically limits how far you can travel without refueling, but it also provides several new ways to obtain fuel. This makes expeditions to distant stars a matter of careful planning or clever improvisation rather than just bringing more fuel tankers. Several parts of the map may even seem unreachable until you unlock new abilities, learn new tricks, discover helpful artifacts, or figure out new ways to craft fuel.\n\nFull description: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29047.0>\n\nLatest changes:\n```fix\n- Initial release\n```\n\nFull change log: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases> (shared with Nomadic Survival)\nDownload: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases/latest/download/Perilous.Expanse.zip>",

Or, this being a beta and my brain being fried on a Sunday night, it will crash your game.\n- Maybe other stuff? I don't remember\n- lots and lots of bug fixes\n- oh probably a very annoying option that will break your muscle memory in fleet encounter dialogs\nNOT SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH VERSION PRIOR TO 0.0.5\n```\nDownload: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/price-of-command/releases/download/0.0.10/price-of-command.zip>",

      "description": "Adds a few weapons and some ships I wanted to make.\nStill under construction, but releasing so people can try them out.\n\nContains:\nEgret- Midline capital carrier very similar to the Heron\nOnslaught (B)- Onslaught variant with a beam TPC.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nConqueror- Midline battleship, fast but very poor rear arcs.  Comes with 2 fighter bays.\nJavelin- Midline cruiser with AAF.  Main armament is 4 medium ballistics.\n\nDevastation- Large slot HE ballistic weapon.   Will show up in mercenary fleets occasionally.\nMjolnir Heavy Cannon- Triple-barrel Mjolnir, good luck finding something with the flux to use this well. \nAutopulse Beam- Designed as a shitpost, is just an Autopulse Laser that was turned into a beam weapon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nPlasma Beam- Similar to the Autopulse Beam, but based on the Plasma Cannon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nTachyon Accelerator- Projectile variant of Tachyon Lance.  Does not pierce shields.  \nLight Mjolnir- Single-barrel Mjolnir, fits in medium slots.\n\nCan be added mid-playthrough and should function correctly if done.\n\nIf you have a good idea for something I should add, let me know.  I might make it.  Maybe.\nBalance feedback is appreciated\nKnown issues:\n-Due to Persean League doctrine, the Egret will rarely spawn in faction stores.\n-The Onslaught variant is terribly balanced.  This is fine. \n-Sounds for the beam weapons are terrible.  Will be fixed in a future release.\n\nForum link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28822.0\n\n```Changelog:\n0.0.5\nAdded the Tachyon Accelerator, a large slot energy weapon similar to the Tachyon Lance.  Has no shield-penetrating effect.\nAdded onhit effect to Tachyon Accelerator.  \nCompatibility with 0.97.  To use with 0.96 (or 0.95), edit the mod_info.json.\nSave Compatible\n0.0.6\nUpdates Onslaught (B) sprite to match updated Onslaught, and properly centers the right builtin weapon slot.\nUpdates Egret sprite, large mount should no longer be blurry.\n0.0.7\nReduced Egret's flux dissipation to 600.\nIncreased the Mjolnir Heavy Cannon's projectile speed to 900, to match the stock Mjolnir.\nAdded the Conqueror, a fast midline capital with forward-focused firepower.  Very weak if flanked.  \nAdded the Light Mjolnir, a single-barrel medium slot version of the Mjolnir Cannon.\nUpdated sprite for Plasma Beam and Autopulse Beam.  They now no longer use the same sprite as the Plasma Cannon/Autopulse Laser.\n0.0.8\nChanges Plasma Beam sound.\nFixes missing mod_info.json\n0.0.9\nUpdated Mjolnir Heavy Cannon sprite.  Should sit correctly on turret mounts now.\nAdded the Javelin, a midline cruiser equipped with AAF.\nAdded the Light Mjolnir to the Persean League's known blueprints.\n\n```\nDownload Link: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1203054429927120996/1208545932912754708/random_weapon_collection.zip?ex=65e3ad1c&is=65d1381c&hm=15d231b5acb41c2455b1a64f4c7e49501a2163251066135644461315b27657f7&",

      "description": "Do you have a chronic mod addiction that makes the list ships command produce several pages of console output? Do you like testing out ideas for fleets but hate flicking though the variant editor for 5 minutes straight adding smods?  I do, and I have spent hours automating parts of these minor inconveniences.\n\nSome commands include:\n\n**ShipBrowser**\nOpens a gui ship browser that's organised by mod and ship class. The gui opens after the console is closed.\n\n**CloneShip <shipNumber> [numberOfClones]**\nCreates a copy of a specified ship in the player fleet. \"shipNumber\" is the order that ships appear in the refit screen. For example the fifth ship from the top in the refit sceen would be ship number 5. \"numberOfClones\" is a number that defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\n**FindSystemsWithTags <manditory1stTag> [optionalAdditionalTags]**\nList the star systems with all of the tags specified in the arguments. A list of tags can be found in com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.ids.Tags of the StarSector API. Input the string that corresponds to the tag obtained by viewing Constant Field Values. Can be used to find hypershunts and remnants\n\n**AddDMods <shipSelection> <numDmods>**\nAdds \"numDmods\" dmods to the ships specified by \"shipSelection\". \"NumDmods\" is a number. \"shipSelection\" can be a number (eg. 5), a range (eg, 5-10) or the word all. The numbers in \"ShipSelection\"  corresponds to the order ships appears in the fleet or refit screen. For example the fifth ship in the refit screen is ship 5.\n\nA full list of commands can be found on the forum post. Note that some of the fleet editing commands don't work while the refit screen is open for some reason. No clue why\n\nDownload: https://github.com/itBeABruhmoment/ShipBrowser/releases/download/1.2/ShipBrowser1.2.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=26261.msg390257#msg390257",

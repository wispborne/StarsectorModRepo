These mods should be 100% compatible with all other mods excluding major overhauls that aren't normally compatible with any other mods.\n\nChangelog:\nNew Drones+\nVanilla+\n\nI only updated the version for Vanilla+ and New Drones+. Did some light testing and it worked. Dunno about submods, I haven't touched them since... I think 0.96? 🤷 \n\n\nMods available:\nAll the Domain Drones+ Vanilla\nRecommended new save. I cannot guarantee this mod will work on an existing save (Motherships won't make drone fleets on existing games).\nThis mod modifies Vanilla drones, increasing their stats. It also upgrades the Domain Faction and allows Motherships and Survey Ships to spawn Derelict fleets as if they were [REDACTED] Battlestations. \n\nDownload Link:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxqxz8w8j4zemrx/Domain%20Drones%2B%20Vanilla.rar?dl=1\n\nAll the Domain Drones+ New Drones\nShould work on existing saves for newly generated Domain fleets/garrisons.\nThis mod adds new Domain Drones. Capital ships, Cruisers, Destroyers, fuel ships, cargo ships, frigates, wings, mining ships, carriers and a new buildable Derelict Station (with three Tiers) to colonies. Also adds proper survey ships and probes to those explorable. Overhauls the Mothership into a more threatening station. Derelict stations can also appear as Pirate stations, these send Derelict raids (you can also buy ships from them, don't ask why). \n\nDownload Link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxdaflon17jhg2k/All%20the%20Domain%20Drones%2B%20New%20Drones.rar?dl=1",

(Seems that the AI is unaware of the onHit effect and was getting overloaded too frequently)\nGraviton Pulser: doubled the ammo regen.\n\nShips:\nEagle prototypes: adjusted all the stats to align with the recent eagle changes.\nGunther: overall stats buff. (LG) version got a phase skimmer system.\nGraff Spee (P): DP 35 -> 30\nTirpitz (LC): changed the System to Micro Burn (Not sure about this change yet, but let us see). Reworked the bultin Hammer, giving it a two stage behavior like a pilum, making it easier to the AI to use.\nadded the Falcon (LG) Prototype, with a large hybrid mount.\n\nHullmods:\nStageone Drive Tunning : removed the penalty to fuel consumption and maintenance cost. Not considered \"Logistics\" anymore.\n\nWings:\nThunderbolts: All of them have limited ammo and a BOMBER behavior now, so they're not so overpowered anymore. Reduced their OP cost to compensate.```\n\n```NOT SAVE COMPATIBLE```\n\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-oJNx4EqGqlmgmGXah2gUoRF-Rp_8oR3/view?usp=sharing\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=18938.msg295567#msg295567",

The frigates' DP matches more or less matches their originals' OP cost, and their power is adjusted accordingly. All of the frigates also carry a single wing of their respective fighter type.\n\nYes, this was worth taking the time to translate, why do you ask?\n\nDownload link: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1jie8F3V4oiafjbCANUEQP0zenKPY-EgU\n\nChanges for 1.0.3:\n- A *lot* of balance changes (check the changelog file)\n- Some adjusted variants\n- Updated for 0.97 (obviously)",

Once you lose 20% of your hull HP, fall below 40% CR, or run out of ammunition, you can turn on autopilot and your ship will navigate to its assigned carrier and land to repair and replenish.\n\nKnown issues:\n-Drift if the landing happens too fast.\n-Fighter Collision class break some weapons that does not target fighters.\n-Refit time is very short if HP is full. (Feature?)\n-~~Unknown result if the carrier retreats with the ship landed inside. Coded for, but untested edge case.~~ \n-ANY docked ship will explode if carrier retreats with ship inside\n-AI pilot doesn't initialize if carrier doesn't have an LPC equipped. 06/18/2021\n\nAll credit goes to Harpuea and all code is theirs\n\nRequires LazyLib\n\nDownload link: https://github.com/CriOwO/Combat-Docking-Module/releases/latest\n\nOriginal mod link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=20415\n\nForum Link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=30297.0",

SystemInRange <entity>[entity] [LY] [planets]\n    Finds systems in specified range (integer) of an entity (coronal_tap, derelict_cryosleeper, inactive_gate):\n    - if two entities are listed coronal_tap,cryosleeper, a table will be shown at the end listing systems within range of both;\n    - LY - distance in light years (default is 10);\n    - planets - filters by number of planets\n\nExample: SystemInRange coronal_tap,cryosleeper 10",

Built-in on Salvage Rig.\n\nTo prevent hullmod from activating - disable repairs on Salvage Rig or mothball it.\n\n### Improvised Refinery\nInstall an Improvised Refinery onto the ship. The Refinery can inefficiently convert Ore into Metals.\nThe conversion speed is based on CR and number of ships with hullmod within fleet. Having nanoforge in cargo also influences conversion speed and efficiency.\nA logistics hullmod. Can only be installed on Capital class ships. Unlocks when player gets Makeshift Equipment skill. Can be randomly found in derelict structures.\n\nUpdates (effectively) in real-time.\nAlso adds the player ability to toggle refinery on/off.\n\nDM me for bug reports & feedback.\n-# Or if you want to make the currently missing hullmod icons.\n\nBoth mods have LunaLib integration and are safe to add/remove from the ongoing game.\n-# **But please make a separate save before removing or adding mod. This is still BETA...**\n\n**Download:** https://github.com/Heniker/Starsector-Mods/releases",

      "description": "A small mod with a couple of ships and fighters, forged in a volcano and folded a thousand times like a ragged towel.\n\nBalance feedback appreciated!\n\nDownload link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeiPi3OE4QWimBE84HykcyrN1F9OWnir/view?usp=sharing\n\nChangelog:\n```Changes in 1.2.1:\nChanged Petard:\n- speed from 130 to 120\n- refit from 20 to 28\n- OP cost from 15 to 18\n- Greatly reduced the firerate of its launcher.\nThe Petard was intended to be a slow priority target firing slow priority missiles. The firerate used to be high enough to form a barrage of what were essentially slow homing hammers. Now the bomber can be intercepted early (if you actually launch the required firepower at it to take it down) and interrupt the launch. Was also a bit too cheap for what it did.\n\n- Buffed Wasp(P) wing size from 3 to 4.\nThe wing did not have really enough impact in my eyes. Perhaps an extra bomber will help?\n\n- Removed floaters from the Supervisor sprite\nAAAAA\n\n- Fixed some folder capitalisation that caused linux to throw tantrums\n\nTODO: \n\n- Fix Anomaly Curtain AI to only fire when projectiles are headed towards the ship\n- Rebalance Stormsprite because its kinda meh right now\n- Prrrobably look into making the Angst a bit more interesting\n```\nCredits to Nia's Dakkaholics and Trailer Moments for the first banner image.",

The player can hire their own Executive Officers from the Dustkeeper Contingency at their Holdout Forgeship.\n\nThe Dustkeeper aptitude focuses on combining automated ships with human crew, gaining bonuses depending on the amount of surplus crew you are carrying around helping protect in your fleet, and in general supports a fleet comprised of a few high-tech AI flagships leading a large group of repurposed low-tech Explorarium derelict cannon fodder.\n\nThis mod should be fine to add midgame, but Executive Officers will only spawn at the start of each month so depending on the date in game you might need to let time advance a bit before they'll appear.\n\nDownload Permalink\nhttps://github.com/shmone-else/sicdustkeeper/releases/latest/download/sicdustkeeper.zip\nReleases\nhttps://github.com/shmone-else/sicdustkeeper/releases\nForum\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=30636.msg449299#msg449299",

Please use \"Save Copy\" before using this mod; in other words, back your save up.\nThe goal of this mod is providing extreme customization; balance isn't on any priority list. ~~Extreme cases will be adjusted but that's pretty much it.~~\nIn addition, this version of the mod **WILL NOT** be supported by lyravega, Wisp, or myself. If you find bugs with this version, please do not report them. Lyra is currently working on refactoring the entire mod from the ground up for its' next addition, and so, cannot assist with fixes on this version. This version **WILL NOT** be compatible with the next version of EHM as a result.\nIf you understand that in full, feel free to download.\n\nHull Modifications: Will become available immediately\n• Experimental Hull Modifications: Provides a base to all other hull modifications in this mod\n• Over-Engineered: Provides 20% OP bonus and some slot-points to the ship when built-in\n• Logistics Overhaul: Strips the ship of all combat capabilities in favour of logistics\n• Auxiliary Generators: Provides some slot-points in exchange for ordnance points\n• AI Switch: Turns automated ships into normal, or normal ships into automated ones\n\nHull Modification Categories: Will become available immediately\n• Systems: Most vanilla systems are turned into hull modifications\n• Retrofits: Alters the weapon slots of a ship all together\n• Cosmetics: Fully customizable hull modifications to change shield and engine colours. Customization is done through the mod settings menu\n• Activators: Uses slot shunts to provide the ship with various enhancements by altering the slot they're installed on\n\nSlot Shunt Categories: May be obtained after activating the new ability. These, along with their activators alter the ship in different ways\n• Adapters: Turns a bigger slot into smaller versions (3 large, 1 medium types)\n• Converters: Turns a smaller slot into a bigger one by using slot points (1 medium, 1 small types)\n• Diverters: Turns a slot inactive and yield slot points to be used by above (1 small type)\n• Capacitors: Enhances the total flux capacity of the ship (1 small type)\n• Dissipators: Enhances the total flux dissipation of the ship (1 small type)\n• Launch Tubes: Turns a large slot into a fighter hangar (1 large type)\n\n```ansi\n\u001b[2;32m+ Save compatible; safe to install/update\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2;31m- Cannot be removed; back your save up\u001b[0m\n```\n\nLyra's Releases & Changelogs: [Github](https://github.com/lyravega/lyr_ehm/releases/)\nDependencies: [LunaLib](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25658.0) & [LazyLib](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=5444.0)\nDownload Link: [0.8.7HF](https://files.catbox.moe/nx84js.zip)",

These upgrades do not take OP or hullmod slots! Each ship has a limit to the number of upgrades they can install so choose wisely! The cost of each upgrade will require common materials salvaged across the sector such as metal and transplutonics. However, as upgrades get more complex and specialized, they tend to consume more resources and even demand special items found through research stations and mining stations!\n\nforum link<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29538.msg432789#new>",

Old name portraits are still there for this version (loaded but removed from faction, so they don't generate and can't be selected), but will be removed in the next. It is so people can update mid-save without having npcs and officers suddenly lose their face, but to also filter out the portraits in favour of new names. Hopefully by the time next proper update is in order, people will move on to new saves.\n```",

Ships all have high flux cap and dissipation, but Covenant weapon flux usage is correspondingly high, take care when using these weapons on other craft, but have low(ish) armour and hull. EVERYONE HATES THE COVENANT.\nShips have a very high cost, default ships tend to accumulate flux quickly-ish even when firing and not taking damage.\n\nThe UNSC is a midline mid-late game faction northeast of the core worlds comprising 4 planets and 2 stations. Ships all have at least 1 axial ballistic shield-breaking MAC and love missiles and ballistic weapons. Especially hates the Covenant, and has actual relations with other factions unlike the Covenant.\n\nThe Ancients are high-tech and late-game (is there a pattern here?) series of hulls, fighters and weapons. They don't have a faction yet so their ships will spawn with Remnant fleets, albeit with a lower chance.\n\nStations:\nThe UNSC and Covenant have their unique stations that they use, and can be built by the player if` ||your rep with the faction is friendly or better||.\n`\nHULLMODs:\n- Shield with code taken from Star Wars mod (I hope that's ok)\n- Hullmods from original UNSC mod.\n\nAssets taken from UNSC mod by AppleMarineXX and expansion by StargazerRJL mainly for weapons and some Covenant ships.\nSprites taken from Halo wiki and free-to-access artworks on Artstation by Jared Harris (most sprites from here).\nOther sprites made using AI (since I can't art).`\n\n`Download (just requires the most recent one, older vers for those who want it): `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EjgjwhRUI16mDH7XR8maKqCeOUtYLZ0q?usp=drive_link\n`Forum:` https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28804.msg423601#msg423601",

They are added as Independent ships, not pirate!\n\nWeapon variants added:\n- Devastator Cannon: version without range issues, version with regenerating charges, and version with both.\n- Hellbore Cannon: proximity shell version (Reaper sized explosion).\n- Plasma Cannon: single shot version.\n- HAG: version that deals less direct damage, but some guaranteed armor damage.\n\nHullmods added:\n- High Spectal Amplifier: same as HSA, but also +100% to all beam PD deapon damage.\n- Auxiliary Ablative Armor: turns ship armor ablative, for a lot of OP. Weaker than Invictus's armor but also isn't quite as weak to AP.\n- Rapid Phase Coils: Feel like Sierra on steroids. x5 speed while phased. x4 phase flux usage. Cruisers and Capitals only.\n- Advanced Weapon Support: +75% damage and +300 range for weapons that go on slots bigger than the weapon.\n```\nDownload: https://github.com/PrincessOfEvil/Independent-Interstellar/archive/refs/tags/0.4.4.zip\nImage:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrincessOfEvil/Independent-Interstellar/master/graphics/mudskipper.png",

Because of this it will LIKELY work with most recent versions of Starsector.\n\nInstall instructions and full details of changes made are on the github page. If anyone wants to try this, I would love some feedback on if it makes Starsector run better/worse and if you get stuttering. Message me on here or post it as an issue on Github.\n\n```\nChangelog:\n1.2\n- Initial support files for mac and linux\n1.1\n- Fix for missing opens in vmparams preventing some OSs from saving games.\n1.0 \n- Initial release\n- May stutter without increasing fps in settings.json, increasing fps will use more cpu.\n```\n\nFAQ: \n-Why Java 21? It is the currently released version.\n-Will it work with older javas? It could but not currently.\n-Will it work with newer javas? Untested, but probably until verification is mandatory.\n-Will it work with Linux? Probably? The only thing stopping it would be if the vmparams stuff is different, like a shell script or something. I don't have linux so poke me if it doesn't work out of the box.\n\nInstructions: https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21 \nDownloads:\n https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21/releases/download/1.2/StarsectorJDK21-Windows-1.2.zip\n https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21/releases/download/1.2/StarsectorJDK21-Linux-1.2.zip\n https://github.com/git-blame-me/StarsectorJDK21/releases/download/1.2/StarsectorJDK21-Mac-1.2.zip",

It should now be more accessible than ever before.\n\nThis comes with a default template for the Lost Battalion, claiming your past as a domain general overseeing the unfortunate 13th Battlegroup.\n\n**[XIII Ships]**\nThis submod includes 13th Battlegroup ships, sporting high armor, high forward speed, but a steep cost in maneuverability. Also included are a set of converted themed ballistic weaponry focused on extended magazines and themed fighter wings.\n\n**[UI / Fleet Color]**\nChanges the color of the UI, Maroon with orange subcolor.\n\n**[BP/Recovery]**\nRecoverable [Redacted], [Redacted] weapon blueprints, Restored Ziggurat.\n\n**[Merge Disabler]** This is designed so that the player faction file will not be merged with others. If you want a portrait pack to supply portraits to your faction, copy or rename the player.faction file in the portrait pack to playeralt.faction. This should allow you to potentially create player factions with **only** the portraits you want.\n\n\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1xAyTL1ZyZ3ZHdtevkS7g-o2JfBEpnQXS\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25040.msg372026#msg372026",

The algorithm takes into account your position and velocity, your target's position and velocity, your weapon group, the positions of the weapons in the weapon group, and the projectile speed of the weapons in the weapon group.  Sometimes the target will be going too quickly to have any hope of hitting it, in which case the reticle may behave oddly, but this is rare.\n\nDownload: https://bitbucket.org/DarkRevenant/leading-pip/downloads/Leading_Pip_1.9.4.7z\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=7921.0",

Currently Included are The Starkiller/Overlord Flux Jets Overhaul hullmods, safety overrides on crack that also paste Plasma Jets/Manjets onto your small ships/large ships, respectively; the Iron Collar Armor System, an armor ovehaul and shield shunt stuck through a Pristine Nanoforge to make the largest slab of steel you've ever seen, and the Hexchain Electronic Warfare Network, where you sacrifice an Alpha Core to the ECM/Missile mines.\n\nMore may pop up when I figure out how I want to super a Carrier and a Shield Ship.\n\nMod commissioned from Mayu; they did all the work and are *big cool every time.*",

Furthermore, the \"Cliff System\" common to all of their ships enhances a ship's performance based on its flux level.\n\n[Notable] changes since 1.8.14 (may or may not be save compatible if you were using a changed version # for the .96 version):\n```\nNew phase frigate, Static\nSurge (formerly Stormsurge) reworked into phase destroyer\n\nWeapon reworks:\nNether Cannon changed into a cluster cannon with longer range\nPlasma Flak Cannon renamed/reworked into Plasma CIWS: shorter range than even a Vulcan but very high dps (and flux use)\nSmart-Flare Pod reworked into Smart-Ion Pod (and added small slot version): synergy weapon (counts as missile) that fires guided ion cannon bolts\n```\n\nFORUM THREAD UNDER CONSTRUCTION\nDownload link: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=15JJFFMbCuBPtuNjctppbQVXQrJzvCWau",

      "description": "A collection of quality of life improvements for exploration. Each feature can be individually turned on/off via \nLunaSettings. Can be added to/removed from ongoing campaigns.\nRequires LunaLib and LazyLib.\n\nFeatures:\n\n**Mnemonic Sensors**\nMarks known sensor signatures with a circle, making it easier to identify that a sensor blip is just \na cargo pod full of metal that you left behind rather than some shiny loot or hostile fleet.\n\n**Gate Markers**\nIndicate systems that have a gate with a marker on the star map (when not in Starscape view) to make route-planning easier. Thanks to <@163467166484660224> for the icon sprite!\n\n**Trash Disposal**\nRemoves low-value commodities, such as ore, from the loot screen when your cargo bays are close to full. \nFully customizable via LunaSettings.\n\n**Grid-less system maps**\nRemove the grid from system maps, making it easier to spot things. Feature was pitched and implemented by <@581474784517292037>, many thanks for contributing it to this mod! \n\n**Garage for Rent**\nAdds a bar event to player-owned colonies that lets you store your fleet. While parked, non-quest fleets can't interact with your fleet, you cannot move and supply usage is reduced. This is intended for passing time. Saving while your fleet is parked is not recommended. Thanks to <@705163319736139886> for sponsoring this feature!\n\nPlease provide feedback if you encounter any issues!\n\nFor more details please check the readme: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/mnemonic-sensors?tab=readme-ov-file#mnemonic-utils\n\nDownload: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/mnemonic-sensors/releases",

Here is the Moar XIV pack, an XIV pack that brings more XIV into the game for XIV bloat, featuring XIV.  \n\nFeel free to send your own or ownerless ship sprites that you love and want a poor XIV cope recolour of, currently working on improving the quality of my recolouring. (feel free to dm me about an issues or sprites)  \n\nI attempted to make the ships balanced but I simply eyeballed the stats based off of vanilla ship stats for the same weight class and sprung from there because I dont have the motivation at the moment to dig into so many different mod folders to find the exact numbers. \nIf anyone wants to volunteer to dig around for this information on your own, i would be very grateful.  \n\nThis update is just a version change, there shouldn't be any reason for a ship pack to break from 0.96 to 0.97, there will be a small content update soon after my midterms end since people have given me sprites that they found that were abandoned",

Hyperstorms will cause these clouds to zap anyone who draws near them, periodically, with a very powerful EMP bolt.\nBlack Holes: Drags all entities in combat towards the black hole, and increases time dilation of all ships.\nPulsars: Pushes all entities in combat away from the pulsar, reduces shield stats (efficiency, more upkeep, emp arc pierce chance), slowly generates hardflux, randomly EMPs ships, and charges all projectiles with a flat bonus to EMP damage.\nMeson Field (More Planetary Conditions): Normally increases non-missile weapon range and vision range by a moderate amount, but in storms significantly increases all weapon range, wing range, system range, and vision range.```\n\n**Safe to add and remove from saves.**\n\nDownload: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/releases\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/tree/master\nForum thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25567.0\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1204273543408521296/1248010288557588510/Capture.PNG?ex=66656767&is=666415e7&hm=24cea2c2e1e169656bbd10bdb2ecb55a6183ea94415443dab30deec2bb2c86c8&",

Fixed some options not working.\nv1.0: 15/04/2024-Official release. Fixed crash due to arcade/simulation having no music.\nv0.9: 14/04/2024-Added (a lot of) combat music, trimmed existing music, rewrote code.\nv0.1b: 27/03/2024-You don't need to download unless you want to change player faction music into a non-vanilla faction using Nexerelin's music option(Fixed compatibility) Also added a readme file & Changed the menu icon.\nv0.1a: 21/03/2024-Fixed crash upon arriving at dead-drop target location due to having no music\nv0.1: 21/03/2024-New Mod Created\n```\n[Download](https://github.com/zman406986/MusicSwitcher/releases/latest/download/MusicSwitcher.zip)\n[Forum Thread](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29440)",

However once used by any mod it can no longer be removed without needing to start a new save due to the save including data used from this mod.```\nForum Thread With More Info: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29589\nDirect Download For Players: https://github.com/Niteghxst/NiteLib/releases/download/Update-v1.1.0/NiteLib-v1.1.0.zip",

      "description": "An overhaul of fuel economy that makes resource management and survival an integral part of exploration.\nThis mod is essentially an alternate version of Nomadic Survival with different default settings and a few additions.\n\nPerilous Expanse makes the sector seem much larger. Not by increasing distances and travel times, but by making it necessary to find ways to refuel during long expeditions. It drastically limits how far you can travel without refueling, but it also provides several new ways to obtain fuel. This makes expeditions to distant stars a matter of careful planning or clever improvisation rather than just bringing more fuel tankers. Several parts of the map may even seem unreachable until you unlock new abilities, learn new tricks, discover helpful artifacts, or figure out new ways to craft fuel.\n\nFull description: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29047.0>\n\nLatest changes:\n```fix\n- Initial release\n```\n\nFull change log: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases> (shared with Nomadic Survival)\nDownload: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases/latest/download/Perilous.Expanse.zip>",

Additionally, you can now have a greater number on your roster.\nMod authors may be interested in implementing their own \"conditions\" like fatigue and injuries. A number of methods are available for other mod authors to hook into.\n```\nRequires:\nLazyLib, MagicLib, LunaLib\nOptional:\nConsole Commands - Lets you inflict and heal the conditions currently in the mod, as well as just kill an officer (but why?)\n```\n***Not balanced AT ALL***\n***Not save compatible AT ALL with versions prior to 0.0.5***\n\n**Changelog:**\n```\n0.0.10 BETA \n- Mod now functions again after being completely broken by reflection shenanigans\n0.0.9 BETA\n- Now compatible (hopefully) with all RCs of 0.97\n0.0.8 BETA\n- Injuries avoided by a successful roll on the crew survival stat would be lost and not resolve correctly, resulting in a permanent bugged Injury skill and a permanently missing actual skill\n  - I recommend installing Console Commands and giving your officers a free skill if you believe you've been impacted\n- The table detailing officer conditions in the After Action Report will no longer extend out of frame when officers have longer names\n0.0.7 BETA\n- Base roster size configurable through LunaLib\n- Conditions resolving no longer causes a crash (oops)\n0.0.6 BETA\n- 0.97 compatibility\n0.0.5 BETA\nFeatures:\n- Scars now do something\n  - Officers may now be more cowardly or reckless when facing certain adversaries...\n- More configs\n- Crew loss reduction multipliers (ie: Blast Doors) should now reduce the chance of officers being injured. Or, this being a beta and my brain being fried on a Sunday night, it will crash your game.\n- Maybe other stuff? I don't remember\n- lots and lots of bug fixes\n- oh probably a very annoying option that will break your muscle memory in fleet encounter dialogs\nNOT SAVE COMPATIBLE WITH VERSION PRIOR TO 0.0.5\n```\nDownload: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/price-of-command/releases/download/0.0.10/price-of-command.zip>",

      "description": "**A gameplay-first, balance friendly, completely configurable skill overhaul.** \nQC brings QOL features, meaningful choices, and more than 300 options to tweak the game to perfection. \nEvery skill has been carefully curated for the the best features from every game version. Most skills are more flexible than before, designed to benefit every ship and excel on specialized craft. \n- Every skill is balanced against all the others and the choices you make will be based on how you want to play.\n- Skills don't change their power based on your fleet size\n- Also makes ECM and Navigation battle effects way more fun.\nV1.5 introduced a **perk system** with milestones that your character automatically unlocks as they progress through the story. These milestones include powerful QOL features and most of the effects are completely fresh to the modiverse. \n\nV1.6 incorporates a few of the latest skill effects in 0.97, but the best part is **none of the +/- raw damage effects** are included. Enjoy Starsector at its **best**, with the full texture of the game. \n\n**Enjoy!

      "description": "Adds a few weapons and some ships I wanted to make.\nStill under construction, but releasing so people can try them out.\n\nContains:\nEgret- Midline capital carrier very similar to the Heron\nOnslaught (B)- Onslaught variant with a beam TPC.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nConqueror- Midline battleship, fast but very poor rear arcs.  Comes with 2 fighter bays.\nJavelin- Midline cruiser with AAF.  Main armament is 4 medium ballistics.\nPolaris- Midline battlecarrier with reloading Harpoon launchers.\nViper- Midline frigate with AAF.\nBarrage-Capital ship made out of station parts.  Slow, but heavy firepower.\n\nDevastation- Large slot HE ballistic weapon.   Will show up in mercenary fleets occasionally.\nMjolnir Heavy Cannon- Triple-barrel Mjolnir, good luck finding something with the flux to use this well. \nAutopulse Beam- Designed as a shitpost, is just an Autopulse Laser that was turned into a beam weapon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nPlasma Beam- Similar to the Autopulse Beam, but based on the Plasma Cannon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nTachyon Accelerator- Projectile variant of Tachyon Lance.  Does not pierce shields.  \nLight Mjolnir- Single-barrel Mjolnir, fits in medium slots.\nHeavy Positron Cannon- Hybrid large weapon.  Probably needs more balancing.\nPiledriver Heavy Railcannon- Large kinetic ballistic. \nHarpoon Missile Battery-Large slot Harpoon launcher.\n\nCan be added mid-playthrough and should function correctly if done.\n\nIf you have a good idea for something I should add, let me know.  I might make it.  Maybe.\nBalance feedback is appreciated\nKnown issues:\n-Due to Persean League doctrine, the Egret will rarely spawn in faction stores.\n-The Onslaught variant is terribly balanced.  This is fine. \n-Sounds for the beam weapons are terrible.  Will be fixed in a future release.\n\nForum link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28822.0\n\n```Changelog:\n0.0.5\nAdded the Tachyon Accelerator, a large slot energy weapon similar to the Tachyon Lance.  Has no shield-penetrating effect.\nAdded onhit effect to Tachyon Accelerator.  \nCompatibility with 0.97.  To use with 0.96 (or 0.95), edit the mod_info.json.\nSave Compatible\n0.0.6\nUpdates Onslaught (B) sprite to match updated Onslaught, and properly centers the right builtin weapon slot.\nUpdates Egret sprite, large mount should no longer be blurry.\n0.0.7\nReduced Egret's flux dissipation to 600.\nIncreased the Mjolnir Heavy Cannon's projectile speed to 900, to match the stock Mjolnir.\nAdded the Conqueror, a fast midline capital with forward-focused firepower.  Very weak if flanked.  \nAdded the Light Mjolnir, a single-barrel medium slot version of the Mjolnir Cannon.\nUpdated sprite for Plasma Beam and Autopulse Beam.  They now no longer use the same sprite as the Plasma Cannon/Autopulse Laser.\n0.0.8\nChanges Plasma Beam sound.\nFixes missing mod_info.json\n0.0.9\nUpdated Mjolnir Heavy Cannon sprite.  Should sit correctly on turret mounts now.\nAdded the Javelin, a midline cruiser equipped with AAF.\nAdded the Light Mjolnir to the Persean League's known blueprints.\n0.0.10\nAdded the Polaris, a midline battlecarrier cruiser.\nBuffed Conqueror (50->45) and Javelin (25->22) DP. \n0.0.11\nReworked Egret sprite and added one additional small energy mount.  OP 260->265.\nAdded the Heavy Positron Cannon, a hybrid large weapon.  \n0.0.12\nAdded the Viper, a midline frigate with AAF.\nAdded the Barrage, a capital ship built out of station modules.  Slow, but very heavy firepower.\n0.0.13\nAdded the Harpoon Battery, a large slot Harpoon.\nAdded the Piledriver Heavy Railcannon, a large slot kinetic weapon.

Includes: event point balance, using Holdout's forges to make Mudskippers, conversations inane, heartfelt or absurd, and the formation of a soulbond with your AI best friend.

      "description": "Do you have a chronic mod addiction that makes the list ships command produce several pages of console output? Do you like testing out ideas for fleets but hate flicking though the variant editor for 5 minutes straight adding smods?  I do, and I have spent hours automating parts of these minor inconveniences.\n\nSome commands include:\n\n**ShipBrowser**\nOpens a gui ship browser that's organised by mod and ship class. The gui opens after the console is closed.\n\n**CloneShip <shipNumber> [numberOfClones]**\nCreates a copy of a specified ship in the player fleet. \"shipNumber\" is the order that ships appear in the refit screen. For example the fifth ship from the top in the refit sceen would be ship number 5. \"numberOfClones\" is a number that defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\n**FindSystemsWithTags <manditory1stTag> [optionalAdditionalTags]**\nList the star systems with all of the tags specified in the arguments. A list of tags can be found in com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.ids.Tags of the StarSector API. Input the string that corresponds to the tag obtained by viewing Constant Field Values. Can be used to find hypershunts and remnants\n\n**AddDMods <shipSelection> <numDmods>**\nAdds \"numDmods\" dmods to the ships specified by \"shipSelection\". \"NumDmods\" is a number. \"shipSelection\" can be a number (eg. 5), a range (eg, 5-10) or the word all. The numbers in \"ShipSelection\"  corresponds to the order ships appears in the fleet or refit screen. For example the fifth ship in the refit screen is ship 5.\n\nA full list of commands can be found on the forum post. Note that some of the fleet editing commands don't work while the refit screen is open for some reason. No clue why\n\nDownload: https://github.com/itBeABruhmoment/ShipBrowser/releases/download/1.2/ShipBrowser1.2.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=26261.msg390257#msg390257",

Controls are fully customizable.\n\nEver wish the game would go by quicker while you're flying your lumbering Paragon up to the line of battle?  Ever wanted to push \"fast forward\" while your fleet mopped up the remnants of an enemy fleet?  Ever wanted to speed through a trivial Derelicts fight?  This mod is for you!\n\nYou can also press the caps lock key to toggle fast mode at your leisure.  The B button toggles the slow-down effect of phase systems.  Control-capslock toggles the game to run in as-fast-as-possible mode.  You can even set custom time scaling factors on separate inputs, if you like.\n\nDownload: https://bitbucket.org/DarkRevenant/speedup/downloads/SpeedUp_1.0.1.7z\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13394.0",

While not as expansive as hullmods, this collection will still make stations just a bit more engaging.\n\nAugments can be find by salvaging, and are an uncommon find. They do NOT dilute the loot pool, instead adding more loot in total. Augments can also be obtained by destroying a station with augments.\nAugments are also applied to NPC markets (Currently, theyre manually placed via modsettings).\n\nThe entire augment system was designed with other mods in mind, meaning other mods can create their own augments and apply augments to their own markets without a hard dependency.\n\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=30583.0\nDownload: https://github.com/nikothedude/Station-Augments/releases\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/Station-Augments",

Lots of ballistic, hybrid, and energy hardpoints splattered throughout ~6 rough categories of ships.  Generally being pretty strong and good quality if bought from the faction but appropriately expensive.   \n\nIs almost complete, it only needs the ship and system descriptions written which I'd like to do after someone other than me's played with these ships to hopefully get more fitting descriptions.\nFeedback is not only appreciated but highly encouraged, please ping me in the appropriate channel or dm me with any comments or complaints (I'm mostly interested in collecting opinions on the ships doe ngl)\n\n```Changelog:\n1.0.0\nAdded - Mod\nRemoved - Herobrine```\n\nDownload: https://discord.com/channels/187635036525166592/1267608001255047229/1270449359053656136",

Before this, they were a large mercenary band working for the independents league. As their power grew, they begin to settle systems they have discovered by chance, and through integration of their survey findings ands technologies of various worlds, they built their worlds into a real fortress. From there, they built an association formed by other Traversers and like-minded individuals. A core institution called [Traverser Design Bureau] guide this faction forward. As an extremely xenophilic faction, they are welcoming and warm, but also bound by strict regulations. As long as you follow their laws, they will welcome your arrival. \n\nWhat can be certain is that the association is providing special warships and weapons to reputable clients. \n\n**Faction Feature**\nMost ship have fairly strong shield resistance with weaker armor.

      "description": "## New game cycle\n\n1. This mod to some extent makes up for the position of the previous old mod, SaveTransfer. When a player reaches the max level, he/she can record a saving point through the UNGP menu (there is only one saving point in all saves, which could be overwritten). The saving point will save your current credits, blueprints (other than the factory), and the current game cycle number (the new save's game cycle number will be \"1\").\n2. After that, you can start a new game. If you open the UNGP menu within 1 day, you can inherit the saving point, basing on the background you choose, inherit 0~100% of the credits and blueprints , and get extra bonus like skills, skill points and story points.\n\n## Specialist Mode\n\n1. From the second gamecycle, players can choose to enter the Specialist Mode.\n2. The specialist mode is divided into 4 levels: Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Omega.\n3. The selection rules have a maximum number of rules, which increases with the specialist difficulty level.\n4. Specialist mode offers two types of rules: positive rules and negative rules.\nPositive rules: consume Cost points and provide you with different benefits for the rest of the game.\nNegative rules: providing Cost points to add heavy obstacles to your game\nSpecialist mode can only be enabled if the total number of Cost points is greater than or equal to 0 and the number of rules is greater than the specified value.\n5. Specialist mode can change rules once a year, once in the beginning by default. However, the specialist level could not be changed during the game.\n\n## Links\n\nDownload:<https://github.com/TruthOriginem/UNGP/releases/download/2.3.0-hotfix/UNGP_2.3.0.zip>\nForum:<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=16680.0>\nSource:<https://github.com/TruthOriginem/UNGP>",

But for the chaotic Perseus, standing the line not absolutely is absolutely not standing in line; After a series of small and large local conflicts, the 27 battle group eventually became even more sunken, but the radical faction was always ready to use terrorism to seek revenge.\n\nIt will be better if you start your new run after you finish all XXVII missions.

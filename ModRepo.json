Add some exception handling when reading the save file, probably better compatibility with mods. If you have some issue with your save, send it to me and I would take a look. - June 20, 2023\n8.

As I have heard it still works. I will be playing with it soon.\nI will also test the submods. Hopefully will update those in the coming weeks.\n\n\n**Mods available:**\n**All the Domain Drones+ Vanilla**\nRecommended new save. I cannot guarantee this mod will work on an existing save.\nThis mod modifies Vanilla drones, increasing their stats. It also upgrades the Domain Faction and allows Motherships and Survey Ships to spawn Derelict fleets as if they were [REDACTED] Battlestations. Download Link:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxqxz8w8j4zemrx/Domain%20Drones%2B%20Vanilla.rar?dl=1\n\n**All the Domain Drones+ New Drones**\nShould work on existing saves, do tell me if it doesn't.\nThis mod adds new Domain Drones. Capital ships, Cruisers, Destroyers, fuel ships, cargo ships, frigates, wings, mining ships, carriers and a new buildable Derelict Station (with three Tiers) to colonies. Also adds proper survey ships and probes to those explorable. Overhauls the Mothership into a more threatening station. Derelict stations can also appear as Pirate stations, these send Derelict raids (you can also buy ships from them, don't ask why).

Yea, definitely, either from some bug I didn't find, or because your standard Fast Pickets have several Supercaps and make minced-meat of absolutely everything.\n\nIs it fun? Oh for SURE.\n\nGeneral Note: If you have no active 11+ planets in the Sector, it might be possible to add new updates mid-save.

You can now update to 0.5, you will just need to refit your changed ships when you resume your game.\n    -Added a block to prevent Cargo Carver, Cargo Filler or Belt Armor on at the same time - They all take from the cargo of a ship, making them mutually exclusive made sense\n    -Increased the % that Flux swap modifies from 5% to 10% - TY Aran1 for your comments regarding this and the above change    \n    -Updated the game version compatibility to the current version (0.96a-RC10) - Minor QOL change so the version checker will stop giving you a warning\n    -Moved the Exploration Refit hull mod from JYD to CJHM - They will both exist if you have both mods installed until I can get around to updating JYD\n        -It removes the penalties from a civilian-grade hull, increases the maximum burn level, sensor and sight range,cargo space and reduces CR loss from corona and similar conditions \n        -In order to maintain these upgrades the ship requires more crew and uses more supplies per month - Essentially an exploration version of Militarized Subsystems\n    - Added the image and description of the new hull mod to the picture on the forum OP    ``` \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BkRmPSE.png\n\nForum:https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25899.0\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1M2ZauRhLyS2q9bucsbRvoVYAeJr1QgwL",

      "description": "From the maker of Demto's Ship Pack for Starsector version 0.95, now introducing...\nDemto's Ship Pack for Starsector 0.96!\n\nA small ship pack featuring a bunch of ships, ~~weapons~~ and fighters, hand-crafted and field tested (occasionally). Put them in your starting fleet, or find them at your local vanilla faction. \n\nFull changelog in mod file\n\nVersion 1.1.2: Balance changes and some fixes.\n```\nShips:\n- Removed the Turmoil from the Hightech blueprint package. Phaseships are apparently just rare_bp by default.\n- Decreased the Turmoil's system charge regen from 0.15 to 0.12. With sysex it was just a bit too easy to move all over the place. Still is, but what can you do.\n- Changed the Supervisor's speed to 70 from 80, flux capacity to 5500 from 5800, and the shield arc to 240 from 270. An attempt to balance the ship out a bit more, since in my experience it remains as much of a hassle to fight as the monitor. Its lower speed means its easier to catch out and also means it cant really disengage or chase as well, while the decreased shield arc renders it vulnerable to flanks.\n- Removed another 'Overseer' mention from the Supervisor desc. I can't read.\n- Decreased the Morpho's speed by 10, to bring it more in line with other destroyers.\nFighters:\n- Fixed some weapon tag issues. Wrong column, oops.\n- Increased the Stormsprite's weapon EMP to 70 from 50 and magazine size to 20 from 15. Now that the weapon tags work, missiles will be targeted as well, and this is intended as a compensatory measure while also making it a bit better at its job. LMK if it ends up being too good.\n- Increased the Angst's armor to 100 from 75, decreased speed to 165 from 200 and cut the system cooldown by 1 second. Still trying to figure out how to make this little guy work.\n```\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ip_qon-RdUVaaNnlMwmMIhnyhmjcJqvH/view?usp=sharing\nDiscord-only for now.

      "description": "A faction/ship/weapon mod. Featuring a high tech nation called the Jupitriss Union who espouses enlightenment via technology, but could be considered to be nothing more than raiding techno-pirates. \n\nAdds:\n-24 Brand newly resprited not-so vanilla adjacent ships, 14 new fighter wings, 28 new weapons. and 20+ custom portraits. Custom Sounds, with unique effects, market music, star system, and deep codex lore.\n-Don't want to join the Union? Raid their fortified star system for rare loot.\n-The Union is a carrier focused faction with high flux pools, PD beams built into hulls, and an energy/missile focus. This is contrasted by their paper thin hull and armor, and high OP costs to their deployment and weapons.\n\nNot save compatable!\n\nI hope you enjoy it!",

Customization is done through the mod settings menu\n• Activators: Uses slot shunts to provide the ship with various enhancements by altering the slot they're installed on\n\n**Slot Shunt Categories:** May be obtained after activating the new ability. These, along with their activators alter the ship in different ways\n• Adapters: Turns a bigger slot into smaller versions (3 large, 1 medium types)\n• Converters: Turns a smaller slot into a bigger one by using slot points (1 medium, 1 small types)\n• Diverters: Turns a slot inactive and yield slot points to be used by above (1 small type)\n• Capacitors: Enhances the total flux capacity of the ship (1 small type)\n• Dissipators: Enhances the total flux dissipation of the ship (1 small type)\n• Launch Tubes: Turns a large slot into a fighter hangar (1 large type)\n\n```diff\n+ Save compatible; safe to install/update\n- Cannot be removed; back your save up\n```\n**Releases & Changelogs:** [**Github**](<https://github.com/lyravega/lyr_ehm/releases/>)\n**Dependencies:** [**LunaLib**](<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25658.0>) & [**LazyLib**](<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=5444.0>)\n**Download Link:** [**0.8.6a**](<https://github.com/lyravega/lyr_ehm/releases/download/0.8.6a/ExperimentalHullModifications.0.8.6a.zip>)",

      "description": "Upgrade your ships using resources, credits and salvaged technology. Fight stronger enemy fleets!\n` `\nExotica Technologies offers an RPG element to Starsector that makes your ships AND enemies harder, better, faster, stronger through upgrades and exotics! These upgrades do not take OP or hullmod slots! Each ship has a limit to the number of upgrades they can install so choose wisely! The cost of each upgrade will require common materials salvaged across the sector such as metal and transplutonics. However, as upgrades get more complex and specialized, they tend to consume more resources and even demand special items found through research stations and mining stations!\n\nChangelog in latest post. **1.6.0 makes the game harder.**\nThis mod requires MagicLib, LazyLib, LunaLib, and **the latest version of Combat Activators**.\n\nSave compatible with all previous versions of Exotica and can be added mid-save with no loss of functionality, even for salvage exploration. This mod does not affect drops of other exploration items, namely colony items, and are rolled completely separately.\nDownload: https://github.com/scardwell15/ExoticaTechnologies/releases/download/v1.7.1/Exotica-Technologies-v1.7.1.zip\nForum:  https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24660.0",

Images must be color and should include the head and shoulders on a black background. See the portraits in the pack for examples.\n- Images should meet some minimum standards of quality, and should be drawn/painted, not pixel art. See the portraits in the pack for examples. I'm not saying you need to go out and spend $600 on an oil painting of your fursona, but it should be at least decent.\n- Also send me something to indicate that you actually own/commissioned/drew whatever you just sent me. Using stuff that isn't yours will mean I just block you. Credit will remain anonymous unless you specifically ask for it in there.\n- I don't care if the original image is SFW or NSFW as long as it's not obvious that it's cropped from something explicit. (ie, a crop of a nude ref sheet is fine; a crop of an o-face is not.)\n- Tell me what faction(s) you want your portrait to be in. I'm not going to add your art to a modded faction unless the author's given permission for me to add portraits (apex design, exalted, keruvim).\n- Tell me whether you want masculine or feminine pronouns. This will determine what pronouns the game uses in dialogue for players and NPCs with your portrait. (Starsector does not support gender-neutral pronouns for NPCs, for now)\n- Assuming you did all that correctly, I'll add it in next time I feel like updating the pack. I can usually provide you with a version you can use quickly, but I only push out public updates when I have a few portraits to add.\n\ndirect download: https://github.com/theDragn/FurryPortraitPack/releases/download/1.16/Furry.Portrait.Pack_v1.16.zip\nforum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=20463",

Didn't break my save cause I actually implemented this change under the hood mid-campaign but YMMV; just giving you a heads-up.\n-CGS fire-rate doubled from 0.05 to 0.1 - I originally just copy-pasted the vanilla vulcan fire rate when making this in the first place cause I wasn't sure if it'd even work. \n-Super Saker, Saker shield efficiency retuned. Logistics costs bumped up slightly. Yes, I nerfed them but playing a meme run where my fleet is just carriers with saker LPCs and saker strikecraft? They're doing just fine.\n-Super Saker now has AAF lmao - the CGS reclassification meant high energy focus doesn't do anything anymore. Also pairs nicely with the CGS cause it allows you to have the old fire-rate for burst damage periods. :D\n-I've added custom nex starts under the free start/own faction options! Now includes vanilla carrier variants bundled with Saker LPCs.\n-Shield values adjusted once more because I have a smoothbrain and thought that the closer to 1.0 the better. Whoops.\n-LPC Sakers got a buff. They get a dinky little shield that won't last long at all but at least it lets them last long enough to fire off a missile or two before going poof.",

      "description": "Mod that add bunch of stuff to Indies and its less reputable cousin...\n\n**Why?** It all started as personal ship mod for scavenger, run-of-the-mill spacer runs, I wanted to add more vanilla-ish average post-collapse spacer ships. Gradually i added bunch of stuff like hullmods, fringe system, some wip industry, and line-up of weapons and missile that i think \"missing\" from the base game, and so on.\n\nAs it originally meant for personal playthrough mod, balance is number two, but it will gradually improved as i fix many things inside here and there, with primary focus of implementing the things i want and balance it later, still mostly wip mod, but serviceable? (hopefully), do tell me if something break as i mostly still play in 9.5 which is  ;).\n\n**What it offer?**\n\n-An hullmod that turn your manned ship min crew to 0 in exchange of being dependent of ship with control hullmod (beware it disabled ur ship if its command ship die!)\n-An ship that spawn an deployable defense frigates/stationary\n-Bunch of indies-esque scav ship ranging from small frigates to capital ship\n-An Frontier System, inhabited with pirates and indies, serve as base of exploration in four edges of sector\n-An Medium Long Range Arty that explode upon impact (WIP to make it Shootable)\n-An Colony Structure that turn your colony hidden (Ie: cant be raided or attacked | also WIP)\n-A 0 OP ballistic pd that exist just to fill slot\n-An exploration frigates that get bonuses maintance and extra fuel effect if its the only ship on your fleet (For single exploration run, literally dram but an actual exploration vessel)\n-An Hullmod for carrier with salvage rig that make frigates wont consume fuel and supply in exchage of being dependent of said carrier.\n\n\nChangelog:\n```-Small variant hotfix\n\n-Ok actual hotfix i swear\n\n1.6:\n-Added Sethlans Artillery Battery & Mega Thumper\n-Added Converted Frigates Hangar & Towed Frigates Hullmod```\n\n\nForum link & Preview:\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28377.0",

      "description": "The Mod Manager for all platforms, Rust enthusiasts, and people who hate their own eyeballs. ` `\n\n*Formerly known as Starsector Mod Manager*\n\n## What's Changed\n- Add Azul Zulu to JRE swapper\n  - This is part of a **research** effort requested by Alex himself, investigating the _possibility_ of making Java 8 the default for Starsector in the future.\n  - Please see this discord post for more details: https://discord.com/channels/187635036525166592/451195604459192341/1091014766031540346\n- Fix versions being wrong in mods list for mods that do not support Version Checker\n- Some internal work to improve performance (unlikely to be noticeable)\n\n**Highlights from the previous release:**\n- _Two_ separate mod browsers\n  - A web browser based one, and a custom one that sources from Wisp's Unofficial Mod Repo\n- A JRE swapper/upgrade utility! Switch to JRE 8 automatically and without hassle\n- Mod deletion! Accessed by right-clicking on any mod entry in the main view\n- Column editing\n- **Near full cross-platform compatibility! This includes: vmparams editing, JRE swapping, game version detection, game launching, etc**\n\n**Known Issues:**\n- Static Linux builds are dead and gone (they never worked lmao)\n- On Linux, web-browser functionality requires webkit2gtk-4.1\n    - Apologies for this. I can tell you that if you don't have this already it may be a pain in the ass to get installed. Alternatives are being explored.\n- Linux binaries are only tested on Ubuntu20.02, and may not work on other distros\n- On macOS, sub-windows may not render/appear forced into the background when using multiple monitors\n  - Sub windows can be 'surfaced' by using Mission Control to see all application windows, and dragging the subwindow to your other monitor\n\n**Downloading:**\nAs this seems to be a pretty common issue, here's two notes on downloading the app:\n\n1. You **do not want** the source code from the main repository page. That means **do not** click the `<> Code` dropdown at all\n2. The same goes for the release page. Open the `Assets` accordion/dropdown. But again, **do not** click on either of the archives/zips labelled `source`. You want one the files starting with `starsector_mod_manager` or `macos.zip` - the people that need the latter should know who they are...\n\n**Website:** <https://atlanticaccent.github.io/starsector-mod-manager-rust/>\n**Download**: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust/releases/tag/0.7.2>\n**Sources**: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust>\n**Forum**: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21995.0>",

      "description": "Need a faction with 10 plus capitals? Come here!   \n\n10.0.0 RC2\n-Fixed Didymoi Minelayer\nNew missile behavior means it activates as soon as it gets in range rather than a timer. While unfortunate, I can't change this I think.\n-Added pass through to the Mark VII projectiles, Caliburnus Railgun projectiles, Charged UV Pulse Cannon Projectiles.\nThese are all big projectiles with a lot of damage. So have fun sniping multiple fighters at once!\n-Increased refire time of Mark VII to 12 seconds.\n-Increased refire time of Armored Box Launcher to 12 seconds.\nBoth of these weapons will be keeping their massive alpha damage, however, you will have to be more deliberate with your shots.\n-Increased the damage of the Orbital Howitzer from 1200 to 2000.\nWith how unwieldy this gun is, it deserves MORE damage.\n\nhttps://github.com/KnightShii/Starsector/raw/master/Mayasuran%20Navy%2010.0.0%20RC2.7z",

(feel free to dm me about an issues or sprites)\n\nI attempted to make the ships balanced but I simply eyeballed the stats based off of vanilla ship stats for the same weight class and sprung from there because I dont have the motivation at the moment to dig into so many different mod folders to find the exact numbers. \nIf anyone wants to volunteer to dig around for this information on your own, i would be very grateful\n\nChangelog:\nUpdated mistake with tanngrisnir where 4 small weapon slots from 1 degree to 90 degree angle",

This overhauls the regular Diktat, changing its fleet into a fleet of militarized fuel tankers with an array of antimatter powered weapons.\n\nDownload: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H51XcLc_BcxJEwAMK5bae1tjAAwsYgxa/view?usp=drive_link>\nForum Thread: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24215.0>",

      "description": "Allows your officers to get tired, get injured, and, in the worst case, **die**. ` `\n\nTo compensate for the increased demands this puts on your officers, officers are now cheaper to hire, pay, and are more numerous. Additionally, you can now have a greater number on your roster.\nMod authors may be interested in implementing their own \"conditions\" like fatigue and injuries. A number of methods are available for other mod authors to hook into.\n```\nRequires:\nLazyLib, MagicLib, LunaLib\nOptional:\nConsole Commands - Lets you inflict and heal the conditions currently in the mod, as well as just kill an officer (but why?)\n```\n***Not balanced AT ALL***\n\n**Changelog:**\n```\n0.0.4\nFeatures:\n- After Action Reports:\n  - Whenever you conclude a battle, you may be presented with a report on the condition of your officers.\n  - From here, you may choose to _revise history_, applying story points in order to avert your officers' more disastrous outcomes.\n- Significantly improved pre-battle officer reassignment interface \n  - Now uses almost 100& vanilla menus. Should overall be more familiar and informative.\n\nLibrary features:\n- Hopefully made precondition and mutation overrides nicer to use\n- Added explicit listeners for: Pre-Death, Post-Death, Post-Battle, Pre-Apply Condition, Post-Apply Condition\n\nBug fixes:\n- Too many to remember them all\n\nKnown bugs:\n- Unconfirmed, but there may be interactions between this mod and quest officers and/or CommissionedCrews that results in officers being constantly unassigned from their ships after battle.\n  - If you can consistently reproduce this I'd be interested to hear from you\n- Probably so many bugs I _don't_ know about\n```\nDownload: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/officer-expansion/releases/download/0.0.4/price_of_command.zip>",

These milestones include powerful QOL features and most of the effects are completely fresh to the modiverse. \n\n**Enjoy!

For example the fifth ship from the top in the refit sceen would be ship number 5. \"numberOfClones\" is a number that defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\n**FindSystemsWithTags <manditory1stTag> [optionalAdditionalTags]**\nList the star systems with all of the tags specified in the arguments. A list of tags can be found in com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.ids.Tags of the StarSector API. Input the string that corresponds to the tag obtained by viewing Constant Field Values. Can be used to find hypershunts and remnants\n\n**AddDMods <shipSelection> <numDmods>**\nAdds \"numDmods\" dmods to the ships specified by \"shipSelection\". \"NumDmods\" is a number. \"shipSelection\" can be a number (eg. 5), a range (eg, 5-10) or the word all. The numbers in \"ShipSelection\"  corresponds to the order ships appears in the fleet or refit screen. For example the fifth ship in the refit screen is ship 5.\n\nA full list of commands can be found on the forum post. Note that some of the fleet editing commands don't work while the refit screen is open for some reason. No clue why\n\nDownload: https://github.com/itBeABruhmoment/ShipBrowser/releases/download/1.1/ShipBrowser1.1.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=26261.msg390257#msg390257",

      "description": "Take enemy officers captive, learn their story and hire them!\n` `\nTake No Prisoners offers a narrative experience that most mods do not by allowing you to take enemy prisoners captive and actually have a one-on-one conversation with them rather than picking a dialog option that just gives you free money. Most vanilla factions have their own defined dialogues as part of this mod, so the prisoners you capture will be different across factions, and sometimes even within factions!\n\nPhillip Andrada: Gas Station Manager has an extensive amount of content added if this mod is installed.\n\nChangelog:\n```\n0.16.1 - update dialog methods to use dialog's interaction target's active person first if all of those exist\n0.16 - updated for 0.96a, with new license\n```\n\nDownload: https://github.com/scardwell15/takenoprisoners/releases/download/v0.16.1/TakeNoPrisoners-v0.16.1.zip",

      "description": "This mod changes the way AI cores on automated ships affect the rest of your fleet, making them more independent but also more expensive to maintain.\n\nIn the vanilla game, AI officers increase the \"automated ship points\" of the ship they're attached to, and to me it doesn't make sense. If your automated fleet relies on the computing power of the rest of the fleet to coordinate itself - and that's why having too many automated ships leads to a decrease in maximum efficiency for all of them - then grabbing a tonne of GPUs and stitching them together with a ship should actually lift some of the weight from your regular ships, not add even more!\n\nWith this mod, when you slap a supercomputer on a hull, it will actually make the ship more autonomous, and decrease its \"automated ship points,\" leaving you with the ability to increase the size of your automated fleet even more! But beware: all of this added computing power will require constant maintenance and a large energy supply. After all, you wouldn't expect a giant AI core with the capacity to manage entire planets to be easy to sustain, would you? The good news is that small ships will be reasonably cheap, but as hull size increases, so do maintenance costs.\n\nv1.2.5 changelog\n```\n- Fixed bug with CR calculation\n- Implemented compatibility with Tahlan Shipworks 1.2.1\n```\n\nSave compatibility notice\n```\nThis mod is compatible with preexisting savefiles. However, after activating the mod you'll have to remove all AI cores already assigned to your ships and then reassign them, or CR calculation will be bugged for those ships.\nIf you have any ships with integrated cores, CR calculation will be bugged regardless. I'm working on fixing this.\n```\n\nDirect download: https://github.com/TobiaFi/TrulyAutomatedShips/releases/tag/v1.2.5\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

Everything is temporary and will be worked on over the course of time. Maybe.\n- 'Dazing Pilotage' duration decreased from 3/5/7/12 to 2/3/5/6. This is to make this negative rule a saner choice. It's still annoying but shouldn't be as fatal as before.\n- 'Deathless' now only replenishes half the values to capital-class ships.\n- Added hullmod blacklist to 'Antagonism'. Added an entire one hullmod to it that doesn't even go nuts at certain conditions when applied to enemy ships by the rule. :crab: SAFETY OVERRIDES ARE GONE! :crab:\n    I'll be filling it up over time if/when people or I myself encounter crashes or other major problems with various modded hullmods added through this rule.\n    Modders can add to that blacklist on their own account I suppose. Unless hullmod does something mythical there shouldn't be a need for that.\n    Worst case scenario I will reverse it to a whitelist and add a config to enable current behaviour in the future.\n\n- And perhaps other things that I completely forgot to put here and no longer remember what that was. If I forgot, it wasn't that important, right?\n```",

This means the mod is safe to add to old saves that didn't use the mod, but it isn't compatible with saves that use the *old* version of the mod. I hate that this is how it went, but its how it went. This should never have to happen again.``\n\n\n```- That its weapons are thought provoking and mildly unusual.\n\n- That its weapons feel believable in a near vanilla game setting.\n\n- That its weapons are good on at least one weapon slot that you would normally leave empty.```\n\nFeatures 2 fighters, 6 weapons of small and medium size. Two of these I currently regard as \"Experimental\", since they have yet to get a full test playthrough.\n\n***Now with a balance pack that adjusts the costs of small beams and tweaks the damage profile of small HE to work better. In general, small beams are cheaper to reflect their utility relative to a vulcan/mining laser. Small HE focuses more on effiency. High scatter amp has also been reworked to make it more useful on midline ships like the falcon.***\n\nPatch notes:\n```- Two new weapons, the mosquito RCG, and the tusk projector.\n\n- More thorough integration into the world and factions.\n\n- Base game adjustments minimod.```\n\nDirect discord download for now. When I have a proper names it will have a forum thread.",

      "description": "`Japanese scifi-inspired ship pack.`\n\nA lightweight ship pack that implements a small selection of ships into your game. All of the ships draw influence from designs seen in Japanese sci-fi media like *Legend of the Galactic Heroes*, *Gundam*, *Space Battleship Yamato 2199*, *SDF Macross*. Also included is a small arsenal of weapons and fighters to accompany the ships.\n\n```\nChangelog:\nPRIMARY: v1.0.1 - Balance patch. Lots of changes plus one addition. See the Git Repo release page for specifics. Summary of changes below.\n\n  - Rebalanced the stats of the Metal Storm weapons to fix their broke OPness\n  - Similar rebalance given to the Energy Storm weapons of the Vonlubu and Xuoffen fighters.\n  - [NEW] Priate/Pather version of the MSDCA.\n  - Restatted the BMSAC so its also balanced.\n  - Buffed the range of the SRSMB and SRASMB.\n  - The GKKRL now fires missiles individually instead of a fixed burst.\n  - The Lichming-nahuo strategic drone bomber wing now costs 25 OP.\n  - Some ships received some adjustments to their DP, FP, and supply/month to account for their apparent strengths.\n  - Updated package imports for scripts that use MagicLib stuff.\n  - Hopefully fixed an NPE related to the Seheryuan's hullmod scripts.\n---\nPATCH: v1.0.1e - Yet another patch. Hopefuly for the last time. Thanks @dirtyliltoaster for your help!\n\n - Finally squashed the AWACS script NPE, plus another in the Flux Shunt Jets script.\n - Additionally, plugged up some oversights in a few of the scripts.\n - Minor changes to the XPDCG, primarily in its refire rate and its projectile's split range.\n - Also minor ship rarity multiplier changes.\n - Updated the mod_info.json.\n```\n\n**Ko-fi**: https://ko-fi.com/x_surveyor#\n**Forum Page**: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=27477.0\n**Latest Release**: https://github.com/Clueless-Foolish-Surveyor/Yoshgramm-wen-Yard/releases/download/patch_ver2/YWY_v1.0.1e.zip",

Can also act as a backup Heavy Industry in a pinch.\n> Advent Outreach: Train your security forces to take advantage of native knowledge.

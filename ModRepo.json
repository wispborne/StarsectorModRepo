(The Lost Fleet)\n- Has an end-game mission at the end of the bounty chain for you to flex your newfound ships. Almost unbeatable, even with game-breaking mods.\n- Graphical changes here and there:\n    - Tiferet is now a bit more chonky\n    - Sunspear has more graphical effects\n    - Rearranged thrusters so that I like em more\n- Damage boosts to built-in weapons \n- More universal slots, just because. Maybe you want more missiles on top of the MML spam, I dunno.\n- More OP and flux dissipation to counter the obscene turret count\n- Replaced bad story writing with more bad story writing\n- Retconn of the ARC acronym\n- Now compatible with Nex's random sector, because no more ships in Duzahk\n- Changed the system for the Sephiroth to be more of a \"charge in with all guns blazing\" kind of thing. Be careful not to overextend! \nHow to install:\n- Delete old ARC version then copy ARC folder to mods folder. Most probably requires a new game.\n\nBy the way, I can't balance for shit, so if you have any ideas please let me know.",

For each weapon group, you can select one or more tags, such as e.g. holding fire when flux > X% or avoiding shields, to customise how that group should behave. Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux > 50%) and two ~~badly~~  expertly done GUIs.\nCan be added/removed/updated to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\n1.6.0 fixes some minor issues, adds two new tags (Range<N% and ShipTarget) and makes the combat GUI lib usable for mod authors (cf. https://github.com/DesperatePeter/test-combat-gui-lib)\n\nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: Instead of suggested modes/suffixes, you can now list suggested tags for your weapons in modSettings.json. If you had already added weapon modes/suffxies, feel free to leave them in for compatibility  with older versions.  (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/master/data/config/modSettings.json#L16 for an example). \nFor details on how to add tags to enemy ships: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control#assigning-tags-to-enemy-ship-weapons\n\nPlease let me know if you encounter any issues or have some feedback!\n\nThanks in advance and happy gaming/modding!",

      "description": "A collection of mods which adds/buffs/modifies the Derelict Drones found out in the wild of Starsector.\n\n**Changelog:**\nATDD+ Vanilla: Disabled fleet spawning from Survey Probes as they were potentially spawning fleets outside of despawning range, causing fleet bloat. This is unconfirmed, but to stay on the safe side of peoples Ram usage, I have disabled it. Survey Ships and Motherships will continue to spawn fleets due to their increased rarity.\n\nATDD+ New Drones: Added new super-heavy drone fighter, the Campaigner Utility ship tends to spawn with these. Speaking of the campaigner, it now has a Hanger to support the new drone fighter.\n\n**Mods available:**\n**All the Domain Drones+ Vanilla**\nThis mod modifies Vanilla drones, increasing their stats. It also upgrades the Domain Faction and allows Motherships and Survey Ships to spawn Derelict fleets as if they were [REDACTED] Battlestations. **Download Link:**  https://www.dropbox.com/s/lxqxz8w8j4zemrx/Domain%20Drones%2B%20Vanilla.rar?dl=1\n\n**All the Domain Drones+ New Drones**\nThis mod adds new Domain Drones. Capital ships, Cruisers, Destroyers, fuel ships, cargo ships, frigates, wings, mining ships, carriers and a new buildable Derelict Station (with three Tiers) to colonies. **Download Link:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxdaflon17jhg2k/All%20the%20Domain%20Drones%2B%20New%20Drones.rar?dl=1\n\nAdditional submods exist that buff Domain Drones from other mods and allows them to be acquired as blueprints, these are found in the forum below.\n\n**Forum:**\n<https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25888.msg385285#msg385285>\n\n**My Discord server:**\n<https://discord.gg/9TEbd4j9XN>",

I will, of course, continue maintaining it, but there will be no more major content additions unless I feel particularly inspired.\n\n**Save compatible**, and can be added to an existing save- it will generate the faction and systems on its own. \n1.1.0b:\n- Fixed a crash and some weapons and hullmods that would cause issues on the Python.\n1.1.0a: \n- Fixed a math error on the Python's system that made long-range, high-velocity guns split far too much. \n- Fixed an error where Range Synchronizer was including deco weapons in its range calculation\n- Made the Black Ops mission slightly harder.\n\nNew in 1.1.0:\n- Boa-class phase destroyer: An aggressive phase destroyer with good turret coverage. System is Pursuit Mode, which increases forward speed and weapon damage.\n- Mission (\"Black Ops\"). Completing it will unlock a start option with the Anaconda. Completing it with a perfect score will unlock a special start option.\n\nChanges:\n- Networked Targeting Array: Fighter range bonus is now based on the average range bonus affecting your weapons instead of the smallest bonus.\n- Augmented Range Synchronizer: No longer excludes beam weapons. The modular version is unchanged.\n- Limited Magazines (builtin on phase ships): No longer reduces fire rate. Instead, reduces missile ammo capacity.\n- Mamba: Added Limited Magazines. Removed Augmented Range Synchronizer.\n- Goanna: Added Augmented Range Synchronizer.\n- Najash: Increased DP/supply cost (8 -> 9).\n\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22704\nDirect Download: https://github.com/theDragn/ApexDesignCollective/releases/download/1.1.0/Apex.Design.Collective_1.1.0b.zip",

Shouldn't be safe to remove.\n```-Added Exarch-class hybrid bomber\n-Redid the Noxal-class Gunship sprite, no longer as unnecessarily big. Also rebalanced it by giving it more missiles, a shield, but less health. Also reduced turret arcs on the Vulcans\n-Slightly changed the Legitimator-class sprite\n-Rebalanced the Tantieme, reduced damage and increased OP cost\n-Added No Weapon Flux to a few fighters that didn’t have it\n-Reduced damage of the Raniform LRM, increased EMP and gave it better visuals\n-Changed the Dedicant Autocannons on the Limerence (and Lacustrine), now each have different damage types and cause explosions\n-Buffed the Limerence via cannon changes ^ and a new built-in hullmod increasing vent rate\n-Overfed Magazines is no longer able to be s-modded\n-Updated and added a bunch of descriptions\n```\n**PLEASE** give me feedback via direct message.

(Like a phasegon)\nSave Comp most likely (edited)\n\nIf you have any feedback or stuff, just ping me or leave a message on the forums.\n\n(PSA: **I am a dumbass who forgot to put the variants for Garuda/Owl LG and Diaz into the default Ship roles, you can either add it manually or wait for the hotfix tomorrow to fix that** )\n\n(PSA2: **The hotfix has been applied, just redownload the mod and the ships should spawn in fleets now**)",

Something like that.\n\nIf you don't use Tahlan Shipworks and/or Iron Shell, remove all files starting with tahlan_ and eis_ respectively from data/weapons. Don't really have a cleaner way of handling that, sorry.```\n\n**Requires trailer moments.** Don't ping me if something is broken, this one is provided as-is.

      "description": "Ever felt the Sindrian Diktat was too weak as a faction? Ever wanted to see it actually do anything in Nexerelin games without flopping and dying as soon as another faction remembers it exists?\n\nWell look no further! This mod considerably buffs up the Sindrian Diktat to somewhere between Tri-Tachyon and PL/Hegemony level of size and power. Unfortunately no ships are added since other mods(SWP, Ludd and Lions) have already added those, however this mod instead gives them a new system and new markets.\n\nNow also giving some love to Tri-Tachyon(maybe a bit too much love).\n\nNow compatible with PAGSM(hopefully).\n\n**Partially save compatible - Won’t crash your game if loaded in the midst of a save, but many features(primarily markets) will not be applied to the existing savegame**\n\n**Requires Nexerelin**\n\n```\nChanges:\n- Compatibility update with PAGSM, added markets now have different descriptions when PAGSM is used(highly recommended to be used with an upcoming PAGSM compatibility update for DE)\n- Compatibility update with 0.95.1a-RC6\n```\n\n**Download Below**",

Its founding dates back to a pre-Collapse powerful smuggling ring, with ties to many of the equipment testing units of the Domain of Man, selling prototypes to various corporations at high prices. With the failure of the Gates, the upper echelons of the syndicate were trapped in a secret warehouse in Perseus. Knowing that the power at their disposal was far from sufficient to protect the precious cargo in the warehouse, they relied on the mountains of supplies within to completely disappear from the incoming disputes and set up the FSF predecessor as an underground organization.\n\nIn the golden age after the First AI War, the sporadic appearance of foreign trade warships that people had never seen before in the defense of the Edge World colonies symbolized the FSF's emergence on the Perseus scene as the giant corporation known today for providing, among other things, shipbuilding, military instruction, and weapons trade. Although they have always been a mega-corporation following the laws of the Hegemony throughout the Sector, in recent years their fleet numbers have risen steeply to show their ambition.```\nAdds the eponymous faction, a few new mechanics, a quest alongside a plethora or ships and weapons.\n\nNote that release may have some translation errors or idiosyncrasies.

Moderate testing suggests a ~25% increase in performance in large battles with many fighter/ships, your mileage may vary.\n> Crisp 😩 👌 and smooth engine visual\n\nCaveats:\n> Does not affect missile engines, they will still use vanilla behaviour. Engine colour changing has been implemented for Safety Overrides, Plasma Jets and Plasma Burn, however any other modded effects will not take effect because it is hardcoded, this is not fixable unfortunately.\n**Download:** https://github.com/automatopaste/fast-engine-rendering/releases/download/v1.1.0/FastEngineRendering_v1.1.0.zip",

Brought to you lovingly after a week of testing.\n\n```\nPacks Included:\n- JRE7 Safe Pack\n- JRE8 Safe/Aggresive/Dangerous Pack\n- For 1/2/3/4/6/8GB\n- G1GC Hide Leak Messages mods\n```\n\nKey differences between packs\nAll share the same trait of having a low latency multi-threaded GC (the janitor you may call it) to reclaim unused memory and make the game smooth. For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who're curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn't launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you're using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

In order to get a firm foothold in the Sector, the Gudalanmu began to have dealings with humans, but it became clear that humanity is not unified; so the conflicts with the Gudalanmu are still ongoing.\"\n\nGudalanmu ships specialize in energy and missile weapons, with very few ballistic-capable mounts and fewer in-faction ballistic weapons.

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.4 Changes*\n\n-Both Fang and Draco have had their markets beefed up, and their faction stats overhauled.\n-Added spicy boss-ish fleets to Phylum and Prestor John systems.\n-Added Two MagicBounties, giving you a chance to find and use some truly despicable boats.\n-Fiddled with a lot of the stats.\n-Lots of tiny little fixes.\n\n*0.0.4a Changes*\n-Forum release\n||-I remember I fixed a key problem with some FANG ships, but for the life of me I cannot remember exactly what was wrong.||\n\n*Savegame Compatible, but beyond the MagicBounties you won't see new stuff without a new game*\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_4a.zip",

(For those familiar with my previous work, it's probably about on-tier with the Raphus). It's pretty rare, but maybe if you make really nice with the Independents and visit their military markets, it might be easier to get one, if I set things up right.\n\nChangelog for last patch:\n-Made the Saker wing an actual fighter (whoops)\n-Buffed the CGS\n\nThe tl;dr:\n-Adds two new strikecraft (Saker-class Multirole Fighter and the Prototype variant).\n-Adds one new weapon.\n-Just a mini-mod that I made for fun. My approach was to make one new fighter I could take absolute pride in. To that end, I needed to give it its own gun as well, so I did.",

Hyperstorms will cause these clouds to zap anyone who draws near them, periodically, with a very powerful EMP bolt.\nBlack Holes: Drags all entities in combat towards the black hole, and increases time dilation of all ships.\nPulsars: Pushes all entities in combat away from the pulsar, reduces shield stats (efficiency, more upkeep, emp arc pierce chance), slowly generates hardflux, randomly EMPs ships, and charges all projectiles with a flat bonus to EMP damage.\n\nSafe to add and remove from saves. \n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25567\n\n```Changelog:\n1.1.4:\nOnce again, changed how the OS detection works to maybe fix the fucking classnotfound crash\n```",

Totally didn't just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I'm not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn't not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts. The only exception is the Lion Guard Falcon, which is about as common as the Lion Guard Eagle from the base SWP mod. Let me know if any ship seems to be spawning too much or too little.\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**\nThis mod requires Ship/Weapon Pack to work!\n\nAdded download link after posting because am stupid:\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24151.0",

It should now display and act exactly as configured.\n- Restored Bulk Transport's civilian ship burn bonus and added the corresponding config. \n111h\n- Removed a duplicate Hypercognition skill.

If a faction pulls from low-tech or midline, you will only find them there.

As they grew in power, they settled the system they had stumbled upon and built it into a true fortress by integrating the technologies and exploration of various worlds, creating this association of travellers and like-minded people. A central body, the Traverser Design Bureau, leads the way as an extremely outwardly friendly force that is hospitable but strictly disciplined. As long as you abide by their laws, you will be more than welcome within Intersection.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Bureau is now offering special warships and weapons to reputable clients.```\n- EN version 1.3.1 hotfix\n- Fixed various translation problems and errors",

      "description": "This mod intends to change the way AI officers assigned to automated ships affect the rest of your fleet.\n\nThis mod makes it more viable to have powerful automated fleets. It's possible, for example, to have up to three Radiants in your fleet without suffering any CR maluses. The drawback is an increase in the amount monthly supplies required to keep your ships operational. You'll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I'm open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.2 changelog\n```\n- Fixed NullPointer error when loading the game\n- (Hopefully) fixed negative ship weight bug\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

Again.\n- 'The Unyielding' now benefits flagship's modules as well.\n\nBugfixes:\n- Temporarily stopped 'Antagonism' from working on Blade Breakers to avoid summoning Combat Engine Breakers.\n- Hopefully fixed 'Full Throttle' shenanigans.\n\nv1.1.0 as of 16.02.2023\nContent:\n- Added 6 negative, 1 positive and 1 milestone rules.\n\nChanges:\n- Now depends on MagicLib. I don't suppose there are people who don't have it.\n- Changed 'The Unyielding' jitter into under jitter and increased it's visibility.\n- Changed sound effect and added simple visual effect to \"Deathless\" triggering.\n- Adjusted 'Fox' description for clarity.\n```",

      "description": "Nobody saw that.\n\nNot save compatible with ***any*** previous versions of the mod.\n\nForeword:\nSo as far as I'm concerned, this mod is now finished. I needed to remove the mod's modularity because hidden modular hardpoints kept breaking other people's mods. As a result, removing the loadout flexibility was a necessary step, as the weapon sprites covered all of the actual ship. It was a necessary step for functionality, but with my own level of skill, I wouldn't be able to preserve my original vision for the mod by doing any decoration weapon wizardry.\n\nSo it was a lot of fun, and I don't regret my time spent on this little endeavour, but this is the final update for SIMP, barring any catastrophic issues that need immediate resolution.\n\nThe tl;dr:\n-Requires Arma Armatura and its dependencies to work.\n-Adds six strikecraft and five fighters.\n-Safe to add, can't verify whether safe to remove.\n\nChanges this patch:\n-All ships have built-in, pre-selected weapon loadouts now.\n-All ships now generate no weapon flux.\n-Flux values drastically reduced to accommodate for weapons no longer creating flux. Flux values are for shields only, now.\n\nChanges last patch:\n-Brought DP costs slightly back up, and increased wing OP costs as well. Even after the rework, they're still way stronger than vanilla fighters, and those values should reflect that. \n\nCredits/Shoutouts:\n-Shoi for designing ARMAA and making this project possible in the first place.\n-CenturionChet for inspiring me to go down this rabbithole  by making his own mod first.\n-Tibby for thinking my kitbashed sprites are cute.\n-Amazigh for advising me about kitbashing's viability when I was initially struggling with spriting.\n-Doogydong for advice on balance revolving around the Raphus.\n-Lavoroxan for more advice around balancing the mod in general!\n-Quartofel for doling out advice as well.\n-Anyone else whose usernames I can't recall off the top of my head, who helped me with my many, many questions.\n-And the entire community.

Do you have so many ships in your game that your Simulation's Deployment screen takes 10 seconds to load and tanks your framerate while open?\n\nYou probably answered no to most/all of these questions, but to the few who are still reading, congratulations! I made a tool specifically to address this niche issue. SSOS is an interactive Python script that allows you to instantly strip those pesky sim_opponent.CSVs from all of your mods, leaving you with a smooth and uncluttered Deployment screen.

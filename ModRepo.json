      "description": "Forum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21280.0\nDownload: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/releases\n\nThis mod gives you more control over the way weapon groups behave when on autofire. For each weapon group, you can select one or more tags, such as e.g. holding fire when flux > X% or avoiding shields, to customise how that group should behave. Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux > 50%) and two ~~badly~~  expertly done GUIs.\nCan be added/removed/updated to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\n1.6.0 fixes some minor issues, adds two new tags (Range<N% and ShipTarget) and makes the combat GUI lib usable for mod authors (cf. https://github.com/DesperatePeter/test-combat-gui-lib)\n\nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: Instead of suggested modes/suffixes, you can now list suggested tags for your weapons in modSettings.json. If you had already added weapon modes/suffxies, feel free to leave them in for compatibility  with older versions.  (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/master/data/config/modSettings.json#L16 for an example). \nFor details on how to add tags to enemy ships: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control#assigning-tags-to-enemy-ship-weapons\n\nPlease let me know if you encounter any issues or have some feedback!\n\nThanks in advance and happy gaming/modding!",

Summary[/b]: \n<br />\n<br />This mod adds the new faction, [b]Arian Empire[/b] in the Alphard system in the northwest of the core worlds, nearest the Westenesse system. The original idea for this mod is simple: I want to pilot mechs. Thus, the core ships of the Empire consist of massive [b]Expansion Ships[/b] which resemble stations rather than battleships. They are slow and cumbersome, but all of their core modules (which you control) come with the special [b]Panzerkleid[/b] system - which spawns a special mech you control fly around with.\n<br />\n<br />The Empire's tactics revolves around these Expansion Ships. They do have smaller ships in the fleet, but they are all slaved to their home bases, much like their fighters. And speaking of fighters, the faction [b]exclusively[/b] uses mechs and tanks for fighters. The faction's lineup is filled with short-ranged brawlers, built to slug it out with near-peer ships or swarm around larger ones to slow them down enough for the Expansion Ships to get into position and finish the job using immense firepower.\n<br />\n<br />[b]In-Depth Details:[/b]\n<br />This roster is made of two types of ship: First is the [b]Expansion Ship[/b], large, armed to the teeth, and equipped with multiple shield generators centered around a *very* fragile core. The ship itself is too slow to get into the thick of battle, so you use its shipsystem to generate your Panzerkleid and join the lighter forces. The second are the [b]Dedicated Combat Craft[/b]. Small, cheap to produce but packs respectable firepower. These will make up your frontline and they come with special mods that make them extremely cheap to run and makes losing one not a big deal.\n<br />\n<br />The ships all come with a base black coat with green undertones and gold trims. I recommend using a more military-themed portrait pack to go with the theme, such as [url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=15939.0]Haze's Girls Frontline Portrait Pack[/url]! Yes, they are all girls too.\n<br />\n<br />The weapon list features cannons and seemingly low-tech gear. Facsimiles of WWII era weapons such as flak cannons and rocket artillery, for the most part. This is juxtaposed by mech infantry armed with bolt-action rifles and hand grenade. And just like their inspirations, the faction works well with slow, grinding warfare.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b]tl;dr:[/b]\n<br />- MECHS AND TANKS\n<br />- MECHS that you can PILOT.\n<br />- Massive station-sized ships, escorted by frigates and destroyers.\n<br />- Good at brawling.\n<br />- HEAR THOSE ROCKETS FLY\n<br />- Built in forge ship! You only need to find the Forge Mods themselves![/center]\n<br />=============================================================================================================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]II. Latest Update[/b]: \n<br />\n<br />﻿[size=6][b][center]Latest Minor Patch : 1.0.1[/center][/b][/size][center] \n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Applied potential fix to module error without light mode![/b]\n<br />[*]Fixed unintentional dependency to YRXP and RYAZ\n<br />[*]Fixed unintentional dependency to Nexerelin\n<br />[/list][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[size=6][b]Latest Major Update: 1.0.0[/b][/size][/center][center][i]Invasion[/i]\n<br />*[b]Important:[/b] This is a [b]major[/b] update and will break saves using previous versions![/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b]A. New features:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- [b]Light mode[/b]: Poking around and playtesting has suggested there might be an engine-related problem with spawning AI fleets involving ships with modules. That is - every single expansion ship offered by this mod. Due to the fact that this causes a critical error and leads to a crash, I have prepared this workaround for people who wish to play with Arian ships but would prefer not to suffer crashes caused by this problem later in the game.\n<br />\n<br />[i]What does light mode do?[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Simple - it stops the Arian worlds from spawning. It seems you can still start out with an Arian commission (for commissioned crews, for example) using Nexerelin, and there doesn't seem to be a problem caused by this quirk.\n<br />\n<br />For you to obtain Arian ships in a game on Light mode, two new submarkets were added to Nortia and Nova Maxios respectively. \n<br />\n<br />Another benefit to using light mode is that there will be 1 less faction operating in the sector, and less active planets means better performance late game.\n<br />\n<br />That said, you will not be able to access some features such as the new trade goods provided by Aria without the planets, but if you're fine with just playing with Arian ships and weapons then I can fully recommend playing on Light mode.\n<br />\n<br />[i]How do I turn on Light mode?[/i]\n<br />\n<br />1. Go to data&#92;config&#92;settings.json\n<br />2. Find the line that says [b]\"aria_LightMode\":false,[/b]\n<br />3. Change it to [b]\"aria_LightMode\":true,[/b]\n<br />4. Save.\n<br />5.

The existence of the Rathaus establishes the rule of Imperial law across the land; that the strong should not lord over the weak, that the rich should not rob the poor, and that all submit to the rule of the Kaiserin. These tenets are enforced by well-trained police forces - both overt and secret - and as a result, most worlds under Arian rule enjoy a level of stability previously enjoyed only by the well-off and even then, only in particularly rich worlds.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />This is the Arian equivalent of the Yuri Quarter from YRXP.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.ibb.co/2YgX7HY/aria-rural.png[/img] [size=6]\n<br />[b]Rural Preserve[/b][/size]\n<br />[i]A region land set aside intentionally for rural residences.

Large swathes of open country, dotted with rural homesteads, sprinkled with bustling cities here and there. Mountains, whether natural or artificial, promise breathtaking views over an idyllic landscape. Thick forests hosti a number of transplanted animal species imported from Aria itself. They break apart the land in natural, flowing patterns, much like the rivers, within which flows cold, blue water, clean enough for one to take into their hand and drink.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Adds a large amount of natural population growth in exchange for a full Industry slot. Low upkeep. Adds very high income and a medium amount of commodities.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b]F.

They are produced in great quantity from beyond the warpgate and shipped here in containers, travelling alongside the Arian settlers who are expected to demand these familiar toys even as they live their new lives here.[/i][/center]\n<br />\n<br />=============================================================================================================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]III. Lore:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Just like Yuri Expedition, the concept is so far removed from Vanilla that there is no way that this mod is lore friendly. I did, however, add some internal lore regarding each ship and weapon system, because I enjoy that sort of thing. Also, Aria and Caparice share the same lore universe, so there's that.\n<br />\n<br />- So, first things first: How did they get to the sector?\n<br />In the early years, around the time of the First AI war, a dimensional crack appeared in the dense, intractable jungles of Keine, of the Alphard System - a middling Persean League member with a Monarchical Polity. The crack originated from the Arian home dimension. For many cycles, clandestine operators roamed the world, blending in with the populace in part due to their natural resemblance to humans, in particular, human girls. They siphoned all information they could - human language, first and foremost, then culture, economy, technology, and military strength. All of this was in preparation for a much-awaited expansion into 'Dimension Drei' - the endless Lebensraum.\n<br />\n<br />=============================================================================================================================\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]IV. Known Issues:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- The Panzerkleid system might be a bit iffy if you set your flagship to autopilot (since the script checks for the ship you are piloting) - I hope to improve this in the future\n<br />\n<br />=============================================================================================================================\n<br />[b]\n<br />V. Incompatibilities:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- [b]High Tech Expansion[/b] bricks when activated alongside Aria. *[b]UPDATE: [/b]Please check Posts section for a fix to the crashcode posted by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starsector/users/43574787]HighOnMemes[/url]!\n<br />\n<br />=============================================================================================================================\n<br />[b]VI. Still to come:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- More story missions fleshing out the lore\n<br />\n<br />=============================================================================================================================\n<br />\n<br />[b]VII. Special Thanks:[/b] \n<br />\n<br />This mod was made possible only by the generosity of the community spriters who made their works available within the Kitbash Database and the Free Community Sprite Resources. It wouldn't have done for a faction made entirely out of (not)gundams! That would have been dull (and a big pain)!\n<br />\n<br />Shellster - a particularly big thanks for his nice and boxy shipset in Spiral Arms II. Just what I was looking for!\n<br />\n<br />Agreion - many thanks for providing the market and encounter BGM! It's really great!\n<br />\n<br />Mechs are heavily edited sprites from Mobile Suit Gundam: Cross Dimension.

      "description": "When the Free Navy entered the mass infused ring gate, who would have thought that the beings from the other side would spit them back out through a gate in the sector. Single ships in the past that went dutch likely were either destroyed by remnants or ran out of supplies and lie derelict. Marco with enough ships at his disposal, even if he failed back on Earth will at least create a home for belters here.\n<br />\n<br />Current WIP mod to bring the Expanse's free navy into starsector.\n<br />\n<br />As of this moment 4 ships have been added:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Donnager Battleship (Capital Ship)\n<br />[*]Pella Light Cruiser (Cruiser)\n<br />[*]Tachi Corvette class frigate(Destroyer)\n<br />[*]Morrigan Patrol Destroyer(Frigate)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Each ship as loaded out with a plethora of small hybrid turret slots, with varying missile hardpoints, or built in missile tubes designed to be loosely lore accurate.\n<br />\n<br />Weapons:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]2 Large missile weapons, with either fragmentation or High Explosive warheads\n<br />[*]2 Medium missile weapons, with either fragmentation or High Explosive warheads\n<br />[*]2 Small missile weapons, with either fragmentation or High Explosive warheads\n<br />[*]1 Small ballistic PDC that uses energy damage calculation.\n<br />[*]1 large long range Foehammer railgun.\n<br />[*]1 large keel mounted railgun.\n<br />[*]1 medium keel mounted railgun.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Since this is early on, ship models and weapon sprites are all subject to replace. I'm awful at art, but will eventually commission better models, if the desire/need is there.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]TIPS ON COMBAT [/size]   [size=2] \n<br />\n<br />You don't need to rely on your shields. Ships have ample armor and high mobility + burst DPS. This allows you and your fleet with proper positioning to perform fly by strafing runs aided with large quantities of fragmentation torpedo's to deal damage with hit and run wolfpack tactics. ships have a tiny 2 degree shield to protect you from ramming (protects AI ships from insta divebombing to their deaths into stations at the start of a battle) Beware of high explosive lasers. Ships that can equip railguns do not have adequate flux dissipation to spam railguns relentlessly, so use them wisely for burst DPS, or when you vastly outclass the enemy vessel.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />The ships not balanced.\n<br />\n<br />with plenty of OP for each ship, you're able to fill them out with many hullmods. All ship weapons have extremely long ranges. The PDC's however have relatively slow projectiles making them only mildly effective at longer ranges, especially when ships are moving.\n<br />\n<br />Ships also have their max speed set to 600(the in game limit) with varying levels of acceleration, and all deceleration is set to 0, meaning you can go really fast, but you'll also have to flip and burn if you want to slow down.\n<br />\n<br />I'd like to make lateral thrusters extremely minimal in effect, but unfortunately you still have quite a bit of lateral control, but you still sort of get the effects of relativistic flight.\n<br />\n<br />I'm planning creating an actual in game faction of belters with Marco Inaros leading the helm, but I figured I'd at least get the ships out there for people to play with while I figure out how the actual in game faction spawning works, since there is a lot less documentation on that. \n<br />\n<br />If anyone has any tips on how to integrate a faction, please send them my way.\n<br />\n<br />Installation is the same as any mod, extract into mods folder and then mark the mod as active in the launcher.",

Every ship has a built-in boost to active flux vent rate, meaning they can easily reset flux if given a breather: something you'll want to be doing often, due to mediocre shields and armor.\n<br />\n<br />Most of the faction's warships are excellent at crushing valuable targets and picking apart slow, but powerful foes. On the other hand, they struggle in fights where they can't find any breathing room for hit-and-run attacks, or against a numerically superior enemy that can flank and surround them. Using the faction's weapons, ships can be built for either high risk/high reward play, or low risk/low reward play. Certain ships break the mold and afford different playstyles.",

Requires Lazy, Graphics, and Magiclib, and Starsector 0.95.1a-RC6.\n```= 0.9.5boot = \n- Starsector 0.95.1a-RC6 compatibility update. \n- Added a weapon tag to the faction file so they have access to their full suite.\n\n= 0.9.5b2 =\n- Added an unofficial_changelog document to mod folder. \n- A number of changes to prevent BRDY colonies from decvilizing. Requires a new game to see the changes, but old saves will work fine (mostly)\n- Changed the 0-Series Nevermore from BRDY-Rare to BRDY_Rare. It may now spawn. \n```\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/file/m4eofbd569nzb6e/Blackrock_Drive_Yards_95b2.zip/file",

Phased ships will appear faded on the radar, and your ship's current target will have a white marker drawn around it.\n<br />[*][b]Shields[/b] will have their active arcs shown in blue.\n<br />[*][b]Missiles[/b] are small colored dots; purple for enemy missiles, dark green for allied ones. \n<br />The brightness of the dot varies based on how much damage that missile deals, so an Atropos torpedo (2,000 damage) is much more noticeable than an Annihilator swarm (200 damage each). Missiles that are locked onto the player ship are colored orange. Missiles that have burnt out are considered enemies as they can hit either side at that point.[*][b]Missile lock status[/b] is displayed at the top left of the radar box.

The brightness of this icon depends on the most threatening missile currently locked on.[*][b]Asteroids[/b] are small white dots.\n<br />[*][b]Objectives[/b] are large hollow diamonds.\n<br />[*][b]Retreat areas[/b] are shaded yellow.\n<br />[*][b]Map borders[/b] are shown as red lines, with a gray void beyond to show inaccessible areas.\n<br />[*][b]Combat readiness[/b] for the player ship is shown as a vertical bar to the right of the radar.

The bar will slowly flash if you are currently losing CR and flash \n<br />faster as malfunction risk rises. For ships that don't lose CR this bar will be faded to be less obtrusive. If you are playing in campaign, your ship's maximum CR given the current captain and crew is shown as a horizontal white line.[*][b]Battle progress[/b] is shown as a bar along the bottom of the radar. It's based on the fleet points remaining on each side, so the larger the \n<br />green portion is, the closer to victory you are. Allied ships are shown as a darker portion of each side's bar. A side's portion of the bar will flash if they are in full retreat. The relative fleet strengths at battle start is shown as a vertical white line so you can quickly tell if you're doing better than your opponent.[/list]",

The subtility they add is that their ships are generally individually slightly inferior to Vanilla ones, but synergize very well with their wings of Wanzers: mech-like strike-crafts that pack a superior punch but susceptible to enemy fire. To help them carry their missions, most ships tend to saturate the enemy's PD with swarms of micro-missiles.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿A typical successful engagement against Diable Avionics fleets generally requires a solid phalanx of anti-fighter weapons to break the initial Wanzer and missile waves and a decisive counter-strike while their carriers are still rebuilding their strike-craft support. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]CONTENT SHOWCASE[/size][/u][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[center][spoiler][url=https://i.imgur.com/hX9ZSQH.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/hX9ZSQHh.jpg[/img][/url][/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Features advanced transforming ships:\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/xuaQHch.gif[/img]    [img]http://i.imgur.com/XVMGrtC.gif[/img]    [img]https://i.imgur.com/GG7XXH7.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]ALTERNATIVE SKIN MODS[/size][/u][/i]\n<br />\n<br />Customize your fleet using one of [url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/44573931]these alternative skin pack mods.[/url] Only activate one in the launcher along with the main mod, you can swap them as often as you want without issue.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://imgur.com/a/JIYc9nQ]Here are some resources to easily make your own custom skin![/url] I eagerly await to see what others may come up with for custom paint jobs.

Ever wanted to see it actually do anything in Nexerelin games without flopping and dying as soon as another faction remembers it exists?\n\nWell look no further! This mod considerably buffs up the Sindrian Diktat to somewhere between Tri-Tachyon and PL/Hegemony level of size and power. Unfortunately no ships are added since other mods(SWP, Ludd and Lions) have already added those, however this mod instead gives them a new system and new markets.\n\nNow also giving some love to Tri-Tachyon(maybe a bit too much love).\n\nNow compatible with PAGSM(hopefully).\n\n**Partially save compatible - Won’t crash your game if loaded in the midst of a save, but many features(primarily markets) will not be applied to the existing savegame**\n\n**Requires Nexerelin**\n\n```\nChanges:\n- Compatibility update with PAGSM, added markets now have different descriptions when PAGSM is used(highly recommended to be used with an upcoming PAGSM compatibility update for DE)\n- Compatibility update with 0.95.1a-RC6\n```\n\n**Download Below**",

This mod adds three industries to the game themed after activities in Dohna Dohna and three commodities to support them. It also installs these industries on a few pirate locations on new game. Despite the NSFW themes, there is no explicit NSFW content (such as full frontal nudity) in this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]At present, the mod is relatively barebones and has a couple issues I'm looking to solve as I get better at making mods.\n<br />Currently Known Issues:\n<br />The icon for the commodity \"Capture Girls\" is too tall.\n<br />Adding all three industries to the few pirate locations causes them to have too many industries and suffer a massive stability penalty.\n<br />Commodities lack descriptions (I'll get to it eventually).",

Its founding dates back to a pre-Collapse powerful smuggling ring, with ties to many of the equipment testing units of the Domain of Man, selling prototypes to various corporations at high prices. With the failure of the Gates, the upper echelons of the syndicate were trapped in a secret warehouse in Perseus. Knowing that the power at their disposal was far from sufficient to protect the precious cargo in the warehouse, they relied on the mountains of supplies within to completely disappear from the incoming disputes and set up the FSF predecessor as an underground organization.\n\nIn the golden age after the First AI War, the sporadic appearance of foreign trade warships that people had never seen before in the defense of the Edge World colonies symbolized the FSF's emergence on the Perseus scene as the giant corporation known today for providing, among other things, shipbuilding, military instruction, and weapons trade. Although they have always been a mega-corporation following the laws of the Hegemony throughout the Sector, in recent years their fleet numbers have risen steeply to show their ambition.```\nAdds the eponymous faction, a few new mechanics, a quest alongside a plethora or ships and weapons.\n\nNote that release may have some translation errors or idiosyncrasies.

The main purpose of this mod is a performance boost, taking advantage of modern GPU horsepower. The increase is found through removing CPU load and transferring it to the GPU, which vanilla starsector does not take advantage tremendously.\n\nRequires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3\n\n```\nv1.1.0\n-updated shader code to optimised versions from Jon Micheelsen\n-tweaked glow visuals\n-fixed bugs with system activated engines for good hopefully\n-reload engine data with F8\n-fixed bug with force override setting```\n\nFeatures:\n> Replace SHIP (and fighter) engine plumes and glows with a fast instanced renderer. Moderate testing suggests a ~25% increase in performance in large battles with many fighter/ships, your mileage may vary.\n> Crisp 😩 👌 and smooth engine visual\n\nCaveats:\n> Does not affect missile engines, they will still use vanilla behaviour. Engine colour changing has been implemented for Safety Overrides, Plasma Jets and Plasma Burn, however any other modded effects will not take effect because it is hardcoded, this is not fixable unfortunately.\n**Download:** https://github.com/automatopaste/fast-engine-rendering/releases/download/v1.1.0/FastEngineRendering_v1.1.0.zip",

Brought to you lovingly after a week of testing.\n\n```\nPacks Included:\n- JRE7 Safe Pack\n- JRE8 Safe/Aggresive/Dangerous Pack\n- For 1/2/3/4/6/8GB\n- G1GC Hide Leak Messages mods\n```\n\nKey differences between packs\nAll share the same trait of having a low latency multi-threaded GC (the janitor you may call it) to reclaim unused memory and make the game smooth. For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who're curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn't launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you're using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.4 Changes*\n\n-Both Fang and Draco have had their markets beefed up, and their faction stats overhauled.\n-Added spicy boss-ish fleets to Phylum and Prestor John systems.\n-Added Two MagicBounties, giving you a chance to find and use some truly despicable boats.\n-Fiddled with a lot of the stats.\n-Lots of tiny little fixes.\n\n*Savegame Compatible, but beyond the MagicBounties you won't see new stuff without a new game*\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_4.zip",

Big, slow, expensive, and tanky, this is more of a lowtech ship than some lowtech ships. System is Microvent Actuators, which causes the ship to vent with a 50% dissipation bonus for a very brief period.\n\nChanges:\n- Bombardier: Sprite rework, courtesy of <@184002614986407936>. Everyone say \"thanks, Demto\".\n- Blaze Phase Fighter: moved from rare blueprint pool to hightech package, actually added auto_fighter tag this time around.\n- Equality: Minor sprite improvements (I forgot who did this but it wasn't me)\n- Fissure LRM: Reduced kinetic spike damage to 500; with the 0.95.1 buff to breaches this should push it further into a long-range armor stripping role. Reduced ammo regen.\n\n(this time I actually put the variants in there, whoops)\n\nDownload: https://github.com/theDragn/HTE/releases/download/1.4.9/HTE_1.4.9.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19548.0",

They originally designed and patented the first Phase-class ships and technologies that the Domain Fleet usually use. Hyperion Systems was founded on Mars at the later stages of the Sol System being fully colonized, recruited and commissioned by Earth's Space Expeditionary Force to build new and high-tech equipment, systems, and later ships and weapons for the rapid expansion of the Human race in the universe.[/size][/left][size=3]\n<br />[/size][right][size=3]It was then at commented and written by Ayomide Callisto at the days of the Hyperspace Expansion-era that FTL technology was developed \"originally\" by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, but what they did not realized that Hyperion Systems was the first corporation that developed in the cover of secrecy the phase-class ships commissioned by Earth's Space Expeditionary Force to send as scouts in other sectors. These scout ships were the Cassiopeia-class and Eridani-class ships.[/size][/right][size=3]\n<br />[/size][left][size=3]Later, as the Human Domain-era collapsed and the gates were abandoned and deactivated, many of the ships and blueprints of these ships were transferred to the Persean Sector by the Hegemony and the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, but then subsequently \"lost\" due to the internal Persean Sector conflicts that happened after. As the sector slowly had its peace and silence, the knowledge and blueprints of this ships were found again by some Hegemony soldiers at a hidden, underground military base in the planet Jangala. [/size][/left][size=3]\n<br />[/size][right][size=3]Now, Hyperion Systems is no longer an active corporation, but a shell of its former existence running covertly in Hegemony-controlled territory, all their ships are now on the hold of the Hegemony.[/size][/right]\n<br />\n<br />[center]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][center][size=5]History of Hyperion Confederacy, faction of Hyperion Systems[/size][/center][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Year C+87, the First AI War is occuring in the Persean Sector, Hyperion Systems was already an established corporation working in the shadows and wealth of the Hegemony. While war is happening in the sector, three high ranking officials of the company decided to leave the company and the Hegemony to seek better lives and to create their own government, same as the Persean League's goals.\n<br />\n<br />[right]It was there at one of Jangala's hangars where they set out on their journey. While on the hangars, they decided to grab three ships docked in the hangar, a Naos-class Battlecruiser, a Alycone-class Cruiser, and a Orionis-class Battlecruiser. They hated the way the Hegemony treated, and taxed the people after the collapse. They went and went, fought some Hegemony patrols, and alot of pirates along the way.[/right]\n<br />[left]They ended up first at Penelope's Star, they remembered the planet Ithaca, which was on the way of being terraformed, when they got there, they saw that it was in chaos, and the terraforming was halted because of the war. So they left the system and almost gotten defeated by a large remnant fleet. Luckly, they found an unknown star system that the remnant never tried to colonize. But when they entered the star system, they found out a moon of a gas giant was a pirate's city. Sneakily, they got past of some pirate freighter fleet. There they realized the three planets, all habitable, and untouched by any people, nor the pirates landed into the planets. (Though they know it is there.) They thought their ships were empty of people inside, but unbeknownst to the three, they brought a sizeable population from the ships. There they started their quest to start a new lives, and to forge a new government that is free, and open for everyone.[/left][right]\n<br />Now, they are a mighty and well established splinter group of the Hegemony and the Hyperion Systems Corporation, and also defended their position in the sector. (Though they left the pirate moon city on their star system.)[/right]\n<br />\n<br />[center][/center][center]﻿--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Ships and Wings[/size][/b][/center]\n<br />[center]﻿[img]https://i.imgur.com/bVdiTJQ.png[/img]﻿[/center][center][b]Krakatoa-class Battlecruiser[/b]\n<br />Designed in the later stages of the post-domain era as a response to the waves of [REDACTED] ships invading the inner colonies and its peripheries. With its large triangle shaped design and large size and fighter and bomber bays, it will decimate all it encounters.﻿[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/m5fRBtr.png[/img]\n<br />[b][/b][b][/b][b]Naos-class Battlecruiser[/b]\n<br />The Naos-class Supercruiser was one of the original capital-class ships designed by Hyperion Systems back at the Human Domain-era. It was one of the original ships that was sent as a seedship to colonize other planets via the multi-generational ship. Though, through the years it was slowly redesigned as a Capital-class battleship.[/center][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/6xb1Sny.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Orionis-class Phased Battlecruiser[/b]\n<br />This ship is one of the original phase-based ships to be designed back at the Human Domain-era. It was originally designed as an experiment, a X-class ship dedicated for studiying phase technology. It was almost lost when the collapse happened, but it was then jump gated by the commander of the ship to the Persean System as a way to escape the problems in the Sol System. It ended up into Hyperion Systems' Persean Sector's orbital laboratories and was re-designed as a phased battleship and manufactured.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/luWPRcD.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Perseus-class Supercarrier[/b]\n<br />The original capital carriers designed by Hyperion Systems for the Human Domain Space Forces. It has six hangar bays designed to carry advanced space-based combat, and to drop a large army to a planet.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/kcOxgs7.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Scuti-class Combat Phased Superfreighter[/b]\n<br />It is one of the original freighter ship designed by Hyperion Systems' rivals Arcjet Corporation. This was one of the primary freight used by the Human Domain's primary military freight service, but then quickly lost when the collapse happened.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/9F8LZy1.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Arcturus-class Combat Phased Supertanker[/b]\n<br />A re-design or a refit of the venerable Prometheus-class heavy tanker, it was conceived by some of the Hegemony's Freight Union to increase the delivery of fuel across the Persean Sector against the original Prometheus. With additional defences of course.[/center][center]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/OIglvmi.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Izar-class Combat Phased Troopcarrier[/b]\n<br />The successor of the Carinae-class Troop Transport, it is a re-design of the Starliner-class Civilian Transport, redesigned for military troop transport and deployment to planets. Hyperion Systems was chosen to re-design the Starliner-class to a military variant by the Hegemony.[/center][left][/left][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/D4i5VF0.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Alycone-class Cruiser[/b]\n<br />An old cruiser design, originally designed back at the middle of the Human Domain-era. It was originally manufactured by Hyperion Systems Earth Branch, but the blueprints were quickly shipped to other branches before the collapse happened.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/wspEK0r.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Becrux-class Phased Cruiser\n<br />[/b]This phased cruiser was idealized by the Hyperion Systems Persean Sector Jangala Branch back just after the collapse of the Human Domain occurred. This ship was the primary defence of the Hyperion Systems Persean Sector for defending it's trade secrets to the growing problem of anarchy in the system.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/Qa7wGEH.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Carinae-class Destroyer\n<br />[/b]Originally designed as a light-to-medium freighter back at the Human Domain-era, it was one of Hyperion Systems' original ships and it was converted into a crew transport just before the collapse. Now it is redesigned as a destroyer of some kind.[/center][right][/right]\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/7m2TsU6.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Sirius[/b][b]-class Phased Destroyer\n<br />[/b]The Sirius-class phase destroyer was originally a non-phased destroyer designed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation in the middle of the Human Domain-era. It was then shelved but when the collapse happened the original blueprints were lost in one of the systems near the Persean Sector. It was recovered by Hyperion Systems in one of Persean Sector's gates in an old, abandoned, and damaged Betelgeuse-class Superfreighter originally owned by the 113th Militarized Freight Group that was killed-in-action by swarms of pirates and looters at the Persean Sector as the try to re-activate a gate to another system.[/center][center]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/EUyXgEe.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Eridani-class Frigate\n<br />[/b]A late Human Domain-era frigate that was originally deployed as a way to counter the defeat in the Battle for Earth. It was then quickly re-manufactured by Hyperion Systems right after the collapse for additional protection of interests.[/center]\n<br />[center]﻿[img]https://i.imgur.com/Pe5GioK.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Cassiopeia-class Phased Frigate[/b]\n<br />This ship is one of the original frigates of the Human Domain Planet Bombardment Fleet, one of this ship is originally used for destroying one large area of a planet from its large, dish-like weapon that was replaced internally with a Thermal Pulse Cannon.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/xsuWJve.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Achernar-class Phased Bomber[/b]\n<br />An old, but dependable, and highly capable bomber. Using its quad Atropos torpedoes that is capable of damaging even the most highly armored, and hull amount. Designed by Hyperion Systems for the Naos-class Battlecruiser as a heavy offensive fighter.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/DnYgGVV.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[b]Mintaka-class Phased Interceptor[/b]\n<br />A fast and nimble interceptor designed to wipe all enemy bombers, fighters, interceptors, and assault wings. It can also be used to destroy light-to-medium armored targets with its heavy autocannons. Designed to defend any fleet, station, or planet.[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5]Weapons[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/7Ml8guk.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Cygnus Autocannon\n<br />[/b]This point defence system is designed as a middle-point successor to the venerable Dual Light Machine Guns and the Dual Light Autocannons, it is designed as both a point defence system and a faster firing autocannon that can both obliterate incoming missiles and fighters, as well as smaller ships and their shields.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/G5Qp1aS.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Mini Minotaur Cannon\n<br />[/b]A smaller caliber, faster firing version of the Minotaur Cannon that can still shred shields and lighter armor and hulls of ships. It might be a less powerful version of the Minotaur Cannon, but it still packs a punch.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/etKFvOD.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Minotaur Cannon[/b]\n<br />[tr][td]A later Hyperion Systems weapon system design for punching through shields, armor, and hulls, it was designed as a orbital defence weapon system to defend planetary systems from pirates and possibly other invaders.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/XPUyLat.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Polaris Projector[/b]\n<br />[tr][td]A mass-produced, reversed engineered, less powerful, but cheaper version of the Reality Disruptor from a [REDACTED] found to be drifting near a [REDACTED] in an old Domain-era system. When the Hyperion Systems [REDACTED], they saw the potential of such weapons to be used in the fight against piracy and the Luddic Path, and the potential for trade ships to defend themselves against smaller pirate crafts.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/IQbvlsK.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Sagittarius MRM[/b]\n<br />[tr][td]Built from the designs of the Harpoon missile after the collapse, this was designed to be the successor of the Harpoon MRM with the capability to deal EMP damage to knock shields out faster.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Faction: Hyperion Confederacy Ships[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Capital-class:[/b][/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/kKUDBfi.png[/img]﻿[img]https://i.imgur.com/rq5F6GT.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/QLsuDlJ.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/uxL3iPK.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Cruiser-class:[/b][/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6SeTNQI.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/bm96ofP.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/4qVfdaV.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/90wr68v.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Destroyer-class:[/b][/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/SVlMkZ8.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/zf9aRXY.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/sf0Pf61.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Frigate-class[/size][/b]:\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/zEoMZmF.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/3ol4Var.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Known Bugs:[/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />New game bug where it fails to generate a randomly generated system and returns to the main menu, this is not a critical CTD bug but being examined on the cause and workarounds for it.

It is on the to-do list for the next update to either finally figure it out or convert to the magic bounty system.\n\nAs always, I am thankful to the players who made suggestions for JYD. It is a collaborative effort and the more great input I can implement, the better the mod is for all of us so please keep those comments flowing 🙂\n\n**Forum:**https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22826.0\n**Download:**https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OcljFuDNMzE8P2zC1HFzO7JOC0V6ngA5/view?usp=sharing",

      "description": "[b][i]god rest the theocrats, c+00 (est.) - c+196.10.17[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Born from the unlikely alliance of two traditionally opposed colonies who banded together during the Collapse to seize their independence from the Domain of Man; the cult-colonies of the Kadur Theocracy were once a great power in the Persean Sector with their own native shipbuilding industry and a powerful spaceborne navy. But now the theocrats are no more -- murdered along with millions of the Kadur people in a brutal conflict which saw the garden world Oasis, the jewel of the Mirage system, seized by the Hegemony and Kadur itself devastated by a Planet Killer-class virus bomb. Now the Kadur Remnant skulk the fringes of the sector in a captured Domain-era orbital fortress and the derelict wreckage of their once-great fleet, fighting a desperate battle for the continued survival of their people.\n<br />\n<br />The faith shared by all Kadur people is still deeply ingrained in every part of their culture, but where the Theocracy was inflexible and hierarchical, the Remnant is decentralized and fluid. Their shared beliefs have grown less dogmatic; focused more now on the connection between individuals forged through mutual hardship, and less on the divine right to power claimed in years past by their religious leaders. The Kadur people remain staunchly independent isolationists, regarding other factions with at best a wary suspicion born from centuries of mutual distrust, but have begun to make some diplomatic connections with other political players in the sector who are hostile to the Hegemony.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Kadur Remnant, a remote isolationist faction of refugees and vengeance-seeking holy warriors\n<br />[*]Exerelin and Dynasector compatibility\n<br />[*]2 new star systems\n<br />[*]New ships and weapons for vanilla factions as well as the Kadur themselves\n<br />[*]\"ship pack only\" mode option to disable the Kadur faction and new star systems; only including the vanilla faction ships/weapons\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Gameplay information:[/b]\n<br />The Kadur Theocracy's fleet doctrine was heavily focused on long-range gunline bombardment, faring best when the enemy is kept at arm's length where the Kadur ships can safely catch shots with their otherwise inefficient shields and return fire with their long-range batteries, backing off to vent flux between volleys. However, since the fall of Kadur itself some warriors of the Kadur Remnant have adopted more aggressive tactics, quickly closing the distance to their enemies and overpowering them with close-range firepower before their weak shields and lack of maneuverability can be exploited.\n<br /> \n<br />Despite sturdy construction and armor, Kadur vessels don't have the durability to stand in the line of fire, and while their focused drive units provide excellent straight-line speed they [i]certainly[/i] don't have the mobility to get themselves out of trouble. They do excel at chasing down fleeing enemies or dashing in to open a gap in enemy lines -- as long as they're careful not to misjudge their opponent's strength and overextend.\n<br />\n<br />[b]A short guide to playing Kadur ships:[/b]\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/1BzXWRi.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />To summarize:\n<br />[b]Faction strengths:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]High speed\n<br />[*]High alpha strike damage\n<br />[*]Long-ranged weapons\n<br />[*]High hull strength and armor\n<br />[*]High mass\n<br />[*]Good forward-facing firepower\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Faction weaknesses:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Inefficient and front-fixed shields\n<br />[*]Poor maneuverability including acceleration and deceleration\n<br />[*]No energy weapons\n<br />[*]Mediocre point defense\n<br />[*]Mostly support missiles\n<br />[*]Exposed engines and few rear-facing weapons\n<br />[/list]",

Planets captured or colonized by KoT will gain Decivilized Subpopulation after (10 * planet size) days. This can be reversed if another faction recaptures the planet before this time. (Planet capture/transfer requires Nexerelin or similar.)\n- New dockside bar art & description for KoT planets.

      "description": "[center][b][u][size=5]The Anarakis Reparations Society[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/eug9Jdu.png[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />If fragmented and incomplete records are to be believed, the Anarakis Reparations Society was originally little more than a band of anti war protesters dating back to the earliest days of mankind's conquest of space. This notion seems almost disingenuous, as the organization that exists today is made up of some of the least trustworthy people to be found anywhere in the Persean Sector. Filling their coffers with pirated goods for some unknown end, most are advised to avoid the ARS. Most also ignore this warning, seeking to take advantage of their lackadaisical attitude toward trade regulation, or to bribe their aggression in a particular direction. In spite of their reputation, or perhaps because of it, they have carved out a niche in Sector politics as a useful tool for more established powers.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Ships[/size][/b]\n<br />The angular ships flown by the Anarakis Reparations Society are designed to keep their enemies at arms length. With only a handful of notable exceptions, their shields are bad, their armor is bad, and their flux wont hold up in an extended firefight. Instead they rely on quick maneuvers and far reaching fire support, afforded by their lightweight hulls and over-engineered weapon mounts respectively. Caught out of position in a face-to-face brawl, many of their hulls will crumble rapidly.\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[b]Weapons[/b][/size]\n<br />Considering the state of their ships, it is no surprise that the Anarakis Reparations Society favors medium to long range weapons, and thus fields a plethora of unique equipment which falls into this category. Much like their ships, these implements have no traceable design lineage, and schematics for them are overwhelmingly physical with little to no consideration for Autoforge compliance. This forces them to rely on the Sector's more ubiquitous offerings to ensure their fleets are fully equipped.[/center]",

(Thanks to Timid)\n     \n - MagicCampaign: CreateFleet now handles fleets that have a spawn location but no assignment target.\n     \n - MagicBounty: Hopefuly fixed the log spam after a bounty expired.\n```\nThe goal of MagicLib is to create an Open Source, community driven \"library\" of useful (and well documented) scripts and plugins that can be leveraged and contributed to by every modder.\n\nCheck the Wiki for all the details: <https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/MagicLib>\n\n**Download:** <https://www.patreon.com/posts/66188070>\n\n**Forum:** <http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13718>\n**Nexus:** <https://www.nexusmods.com/starsector/mods/10?tab=files>\n**MagicLab discord:** <https://discord.gg/EVQZaD3naU>\n**Bug report/feedback:** <https://forms.gle/YbQ8cYUA5QaJBCYV8>",

      "description": "Yo,\n<br />\n<br />felt like some ships were missing from the rooster. Felt like adding them. So i did. currently theres these:\n<br />\n<br />[center]Midline ships\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />Dreadnoughts\n<br />\n<br />[b]NAGATO[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/fDc9Kkz.png[/img]\n<br />Midline Dreadnought, hulking behemoth of concentrated long range firepower. Utilizing three twin heavy Mjolmir turrets to wrestle with Space Fortresses and planetary ground-to-space batteries (not yet implemented, but it will help with planetary raids), this ship is single-handedly able to destroy whole fleets of capital ships. Designed pre-collapse, but never built, for there was no need for such an expensive ship, new reality of the sector might prove this design to be useful. If anyone is able to find its blueprint and has industrial power to bear, they may as well create this monster of destruction and unleash unseen firepower on the whole galaxy.\n<br />\n<br />[b]PELAGORNIS[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/o7CnRPR.png[/img]\n<br />Midline Supercarrier, breaker of worlds. Carrying enough ordinance and support infrastructure to ensure fighter superiority over any theater of war. Able to deploy dozens upon dozens of high end fighters, this mothership can easily overwhelm any and all resistance with ruthless stream of ordinance. Sleek in its design, only very few of these ships were ever build, at the peak of fighter doctrine, to blot out the sun of many worlds. May whatever gods there are have mercy, when this mobile space station arrives on the battlefield. Provides 20 fighter slots and almost 600 ordinance points, battleship level defense capabilities and station level range. note-i used this with only talons. destroyed paragon under a minute, without any other weapons. Named after some prehistoric big bird twat. same as Nagato, player has to build them, no other way of getting them, and i made extra sure that AI wont have access to these ships. however, if given chance, even pop 5 planets with high command can spawn them in fleets, both Nagato and this one.\n<br />\n<br />Capital ships\n<br />\n<br />[b]STAPLE[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/LERSKkV.png[/img]\n<br />Midline battleship-uparmored Conquest with 4 centered large ballistic guns. Give it 4 Gauss, extend its range as much as possible and watch it tear enemies to pieces from 2k range-great at taking down shields and has increased PD slots too. Be warned though, its not a very good brawler (flux runs out quick) and it will loose even to Conquest in short/mid range fight due to removal of the prow missile slots. Give it some good escorts or fighter cover. Inspired by Yamato battleship.\n<br />\n<br />[b]ALBATROSS[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/gP6beYu.png[/img]\n<br />Midline capital carrier-Conquest that gave up its large guns and prow missiles for 6 wings. it will get shredded by Legion or any other capital in close range due to lack of proper armor and armament, however, it can also dish out serious damage from 8 ballistic slots, 4 on each side able to shoot in front of the ship, but due to flux cost, its highly advised to stay far back and provide overwhelming fighter support. 6 thunders on this baby can ruin day of any Astral and can seriously hinder and even destroy, after prolonged engagement, other capital ships. Inspired by Venator-class from Starwars.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Patrol Boats[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/AtXgK9q.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Claymore[/b] is the concept of Midline fighters lead to its extreme. While being technically a fighter, its sheer size and firepower puts it in Patrol Craft size class. This superheavy fighter is equipped with heavy machinegun, vulcan and 6 fighter class Swarmer missiles. Combined with its extreme range, it can give Thunder fighters heavy fire support they often desperately need. Having light frigate armor, Claymore can wrestle with ship PD for quite some time and other than different Patrol Craft, no fighter can challenge its might, but their long refit time should be taken into account when fighting.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Lowtech ships\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Capital ships\n<br />[b]Expedition[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ATGAaR6.png[/img]\n<br />The peak of exploration technology, building upon heritage of venerable Venture-class Cruiser, Expedition broadens every aspect of it and more. Used as mobile HQ of massive sub-corporations, anchoring entire fleets in deep space, serving as a city, with hospitals, holo-education centers, recreational facilities, enough cargo space to provide independence for up to two years, this ship provides everything a civilian fleet might desire, in their long and lonely expeditions to the fringes of the sector. Has massive array of small weapons providing excellent anti-ordinance capability, 4 fighter bays build with talon fighters in mind, two large ballistic weapon slots for anti-capital duty and sea of ordinance points to give your fleets proper operation center. Not designed or intended to be used in direct combat. Inspired by JMC mining ship, Red Dwarf for early design, then i slapped some vanilla ships onto it and called it a day.-note, might lower flux points, even if all other capitals manage to destroy it, it fares still too good.\n<br />\n<br />Other\n<br />[b]Civilian Combat Ships[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/BPtsSqA.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/Om00REI.png[/img]\n<br />With the aftermath of the first AI war, millions of traders were disillusioned with the sector powers who were unable to protect them. So various small corporations and civilian concerns came up with conversion kits for many ships. Most widely used were the Light Carrier [b]Buffalo Mk.III[/b] kit and Destroyer [b]Nyx[/b] kit.Buffalo Mk.III can house two wings of fighters without any issue, however, much like Buffalo freighter, it has lackluster armor and armament to defend itself, so its rather regarded as Wing Tender, rather than Carrier. Nyx on the other hand sports heavy armor even for its weight class, and able to be uparmored to cruiser class armor. It also has several weapon mounts able to cover its own bases against ordinance and enemy ships alike. Nyx fulfills the so much needed \"ship of the line\" role, that so few civilian ships can take.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Patrol Craft[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/VYZoy3z.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/v5TRzPT.png[/img]\n<br />Ubiquitous on planets of the leading powers, the \"PC\" or \"Patrol Craft\" serve generally only as suppression and heavy patrol units, however, after slight modifications to its engine systems, these Patrol Craft can be used in space combat without much issue. They can fit into most hangars, and while they have very high supply profile, they provide serious firepower for a \"fighter\" class ship, rocking mostly about half of what Frigate class ships carry.\n<br />Two main classes which both have two sub classes are [b]Patrol Craft class[/b] and [b]Gun Craft class[/b]. Patrol craft subclasses are [b]Patrol Craft[/b], with twin auto cannon, two twin machineguns and vulcan on its rear, and [b]Torpedo Craft[/b] with twin auto cannon, two single harpoon launchers and rear vulcan. [b]Gun Craft[/b] subclasses are [b]Gun Craft[/b] with twin auto cannon, heavy machinegun and rear vulcan and [b]Flak Craft[/b] with twin auto cannon, single flak gun and rear vulcan.\n<br />patrol craft gun craft\n<br />\n<br />[b]Fighter wings[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/lCTDvrh.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/mqHqYmC.png[/img]\n<br />First new addition, [b]Nail[/b], represents soul of the sector. Utilitarian application of stripping every single thing from ships, making them horrible death traps for sake of saving money and limited space. While loosing its missile pods and targeting systems, wing of Nails gains 2 additional fighters over its more conventional death trap, Talon. Being basically Vulcan with engine and poor soul piloting it, its good anti-ordinance fighter, and still somewhat capable anti-fighter fighter, but other than that, its pretty useless. But then again, what else that came from the pirate yards isnt. Second addition is [b]Broadsword Mk.II[/b]. Upon closer inspection of Broadsword, it was found that it actually carries two missile spots, but no missiles. Big brain geniuses in Hegemon Naval yards figured they could utilize sudden surge of fighter size missile pods and weld them to these spots. And so was born the Broadsword Mk.II. boosting original machineguns and two missile pods, it became strong contender for the best fighter in the sector. Only question remains, how noone figured out this sooner.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Hegemony ships\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />Other\n<br />[b]Second Generation Hegemony Auxiliaries[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/rvA7wRF.png[/img][url=https://imgur.com/wAItPqB][img]http://i.imgur.com/wAItPqB.png[/img][/url][img]https://i.imgur.com/2DOZ8P9.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/jHo0fq0.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/C54Yevg.png[/img]\n<br />5 more civilian ships converted by the Hegemony Naval yards in effort to bolster the ever weakening ranks of the Hegemon flotilla. First new ship is modified [b]Colossus-class Freighter[/b], which is supposed to replace fragile Buffalo-class Freighters, which fall an easy prey to increasing pirate activity. Second addition is modified [b]Condor-class Light Carrier[/b], while it was already ambiguous across the Hegemon fleets, it never received the attention it deserved. It got it now, with upgrades across the board making it even more formidable carrier than before. Third ship is a surprising addition, [b]Mudskipper-class Wing Carrier[/b], originally used as a small transport ship, its shuttle bay was modified to house wing of talon fighters. While there wasnt any space left for proper shield generator, it still provides cheapest way to get fighter capability to any fleet desperate enough to use it. Fourth addition is another Hegemon evergreen, the famous [b]Mule-class Combat Freighter[/b]. Featuring already thick armor and serious armament for a freighter, military upgrades only benefited this formidable ship. Last but not least, [b]Venture-class Cruiser[/b], another ship everpresent in the sector. By several simple upgrades, Hegemon Venture now poses serious threat to any captain foolish enough to underestimate the venerable Venture. Stripping away its mining drones and survey equipment and modernizing the fighter bay to house a talon wing, this ship has reached new potential, waiting to be exploited.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Luddic Path\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Dreadnought\n<br />[b]RAGNAROK[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/981Rvcz.png[/img]\n<br />Hammer of Ludd. Avatar of his holy spirit, the [b]Ragnarok[/b], what once was a life giver to the Persean sector is now its ultimate demise. Old Sporeship, one of the first to arrive to the sector, hundreds of years old was reforged, remade and refitted with Space Fortress worth of armaments. This mobile battle station, able to smash through capital ships is the peak of Luddic Paths efforts to eradicate the sector of the heretics and heathens. May Ludd has mercy on anyone foolish enough to fight this instrument of his holy will.\n<br />\n<br />Other\n<br />\n<br />[b]Cruisers[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/oqtEPH2.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/a4zPWAM.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/OYSgOkl.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/DWkBelB.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/lxbPxBJ.png[/img]\n<br />Much like its pirate brethen, even Luddic Path saw the possible utility of the Starliner. Haphazardly converting it to the carrier brings much needed fighter support to the Panther fleets. [b]Starliner Mk.III[/b] houses 3 wings of fighters, and while its support infrastructure is nothing great, its still remarkably useful, and whats more important to the Panthers, cheap. While Starliner is readily available, other cruiser class ships arent. Panthers however desperately needed cruiser combat ships. Opportunity appeared however. Everpresent husks and hulks of the abandoned and destroyed ships are all around the sector. And so was born the Panther combat fleet. Consisting mostly out of previously destroyed and looted ships, while not being even remotely as efficient as their new and pristine counterparts, these ships are everywhere, have low support profile and are cheap to maintain. For cruiser class, these ships are [b]Eagle[/b], [b]Dominator[/b], [b]Falcon[/b] and [b]Venture[/b]. Every looted ship had its energy weapons removed and retrofitted to ballistic weapons, due to their lower cost and availability. Because of their salvaged nature, they are worse in every single aspect than their counterparts. However, they have reduced supply and deployment requirements, making them great at overwhelming enemies with numbers.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Destroyers[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/N3eqMyN.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/wCb0bnW.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/SRw77c1.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/zKr7kQI.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/UYzWM6R.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/uCbsZLs.png[/img]\n<br />Along with construction its main cruiser fleets, Panthers realized they needed screen ships too. First of these is [b]Condor[/b]. Classic civilian and military light carrier, only proper carrier in the Panther lineup. Then comes the combat destroyers. Same as with their cruiser counterparts, these are mostly looted and salvaged ships, making them overall worse, but cheaper to maintain and deploy. [b]Enforcer[/b] and [b]Hammerhead[/b] pose great threat to merchant fleets, due to their overhaulet engine systems, giving them ability to quickly close in in their targets. During raids, Panthers get a lot of various freighters. Realizing the boon on their hands, they converted [b]Tarsus[/b] and [b]Mule[/b] freighters into makeshift combat ships. While far from any actual combat ships, they still pose a threat to civilian vessels. Last but not least, [b]Nebula[/b]. Same with Starliner, Luddic Path found them self with massive fleet of these looted ships after countless raids. Rather than selling them or scrapping them, they repurposed it, and made deadly Hammer barrage its main weapon, converting its standard hangar to house Hammer torpedoes, giving it quite a few volleys before running out.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Frigates[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/Vsq1eSK.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/Ddxciyc.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/z52JmBX.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/iK3S9gb.png[/img]\n<br />Much like with previous classes, even frigates were needed, and so panthers came up with additional designs for their fleets. [b]Wolf[/b], while loosing its jump abilities, is still a formidable and very nimble frigate. Other 3 frigates are converted civilian ships. The [b]Mercury[/b], [b]Hermes[/b] and [b]Mudskipper[/b]. Mercury and Hermes were merely armed with two missile slots. Muddskipper, however, following its pirate counterpart, has been fitted with Hammer barrage. While extremely fragile, one would be fool to underestimate raw killing power of this small craft equal to suicide bomber.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Patrol Craft[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/R04oPcV.png[/img]\n<br />[b]Snake[/b] is an old mining craft design, carrying two hammer torpedoes and two small guns for protection, it was often used during small scale mining operations. While rather weak, its the better alternative to the Perdition bombers, which far too often fall prey to enemy PD.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Pirates\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Capital ships\n<br />[b]ATLAS MK.III[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/hF9sFkr.png[/img]\n<br />Albatross but everything is wrong. Using broken down Atlas Mk.II as its basis, stripped most weapon mounts and welded massive fighter bay where cargo bay once stood. While still suffering from lack luster generator, slow speed and paper thin armor, it can deliver 6 fighter wings of ordinance in relatively cheap package (and a littlecorrupted too). There were some spontaneous combustion incidents from subpar quality fighters, but such sacrifice is pirate captain always willing to make. Inspired by Colossus Mk.III.\n<br />\n<br />Other\n<br />[b]Pirate Fleet Extended[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/u0WdAPE.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/E8ZtVuy.png[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/4fDbt06.png[/img]\n<br />While Hegemony pushed \"new\" designs into the sector, pirates took some inspiration, and a nanoforge or two, or much more likely just stole some welding torches, and made some \"new\" ships of their own as well. First being pirate modification of [b]Venture Cruiser[/b], nothing exceptional, except that it has lost all of its more delicate equipment \"somewhere\". Good ship of the line, and when supported by another two new additions to the pirate fleet, it is rather dangerous. [b]Starliner[/b], unused, sat around the sector as bleak reminder of the golden age. It now serves a much more practical purpose. Filled to the brim with massive computers, communications arrays and wide array of amenities to serve its pirate crew, this ship can seriously bolster any fleet it supports. [b]Nebula[/b], while being yet another reminder of bygone era, served well in the new daily reality of the sector, however, when pirate warlords were done with the starliner support ship design, they still desired something more nimble, smaller. And so came the Nebula Mk.II into being.\n<br />note:i dont know how OP will be the new starliner/nebula builds. They will have immense effect on larger fleets, but as i dont really have time to play for few dozen hours with these, i will rely on you, the people, to let me know if its OP or UP.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Furthermore, i will likely continue to add ships to the game, until my inevitable burnout. \n<br />\n<br />[b]Planned ships are:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Pirate versions of vanilla ships[/b] - underutilized designs will find their way into the game, one way or another-some added in 0.3\n<br />[b]\"Atlas salvage rig\"[/b] - Atlas but salvage rig.\n<br />[b]More Auxiliary ships[/b] - hegemony and other factions will get more/their own auxiliary ships, following same philosophy as vanilla \"(A)\", -note, few hegemon ships added in 0.2.1\n<br />[b]Civilian combat oriented ships[/b] - made as part of my other mod, not yet public, in effort to prolong midgame-some added in 0.3\n<br />[b]Dreadnought class[/b] of ships for low/mid/high tech and pirates-only 1 per campaign, not buildable, only scavengable. balance wise-about 1 space station section. (this will take significantly longer time to reach, since it will be harder to just recycle assets from vanilla and i cant draw for ****)\n<br />\n<br />------\n<br />\n<br />I am open to suggestions about new ships/balance of current ships. Staple and Albatross took me like a day to make with reading modding tutorials included, so i guess i could add ships relatively fast. \n<br />\n<br />LIST OF SUGGESTIONS:\n<br />expedition is *** ugly and i will make proper model once i think of something prettier than Rimmers forehead.\n<br />note-description ingame is unfinished and really not the top priority for me, if someone is willing to make vanilla sized descriptions for ships, i will marry your dog.\n<br />------\n<br />CREDITS:\n<br />Nautilus81-DESCRIPTION OF SHIPS:Staple, Albatross, Atlas Mk.III,Patrol Craft,Expedition,Buffalo Mk.III,Nyx\n<br />Archaeon-DESCRIPTION OF SHIPS:Broadsword Mk.II, Colossus, Condor, Mudskipper, Mule, Nagato, Nail, Nebula Mk.II, Starliner Mk.II, Venture, Pirate Venture\n<br />------\n<br />\n<br />CHANGELOG[spoiler]\n<br />0.4.-25.11.2019-Ludd Path update, hella path ships, modified weight values so path would use exclusively path ships (ships that were blessed by the ludd, so they can use the fuel \"luciferium\") and added midline superheavy fighter and several small corrections on other ships and made new mod page layout.\n<br />0.3.4.-08.11.2019-Bunch of minor balance tweaks, added missile slots to mule, added supercarrier Pelagornis. bunch of other changes i forgot. Made sure so that AI wont be able to use super ships.\n<br />0.3.3 hotfix1-29.10.2019-nagato wasnt attacked by enemies, for some reason. fixed\n<br />0.3.3.-26.10.2019-Introduced Nagato, Nail and broadsword Mk.II. Several corrections and balance changes applied. NAGATO CAN BE ONLY BUILD FROM BLUEPRINT FROM THIS VERSION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. Added few descriptions\n<br />0.3.2.-15.10.2019-balance update mostly. fixed pirate starliner and made ventures less beefy-hegemony venture could reach 2400 armor easily. that wont do.\n<br />0.3.1.hotfix1-09.10.2019-pirate venture had bugged collision detection, remade it, works in my game. renamed starliner and nebula roles.\n<br />0.3.1.-08.10.2019:fixed starliner and nebula clasification, upped maintenance and fleet points of albatross, made pirate venture more combat oriented and changed its built in hangar into converted hangar bay\n<br />0.3.-07.10.2019:Added pirate ships:Venture, starliner support and nebula support. Added civilian ships:Nyx destroyer and Buffalo wing tender. Added Patrol Craft\n<br />0.2.2.-26.9.2019:made few graphical improvements on ships, made OP adjustments for few ships, removed two medium energy slots from albatross, fixed expedition, no longer frigate but capital.\n<br />0.2.1.hotfix1-26.09.2019:Expedition spawns within 4 factions, with independents being main sellers. i dont know what was wrong, i just rewrote half of the data and somehow it worked. ship was ingame and working, but for some reason wasnt recognized by markets.\n<br />0.2.1-31.8.2019:added Expedition and several Hegemony auxiliaries. Upped auxiliary use by hegemony by 0.5.\n<br />0.2-20.8.2019:added Atlas Mk.III, made factions use new ships/made ships actually buyable\n<br />0.1-18.8.2019:RELEASE[/spoiler]",

Totally didn't just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I'm not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn't not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts.

It should now display and act exactly as configured.\n- Restored Bulk Transport's civilian ship burn bonus and added the corresponding config. \n111h\n- Removed a duplicate Hypercognition skill.

Before the Collapse, the S.C.o.Y. was a nomadic colony built inside an asteroid to travel the stars and study the universe one system at a time. When the Great Collapse occurred and the gate system shutdown the colony became trapped in the Sector, its inhabitants found themselves at the unfortunate center of attention of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the Hegemony and the Luddic Church, all eager to get their hands on Yggdrasill's mini-autofactory and its intact pre-collapse UAC library. Using the gigantic ship as a Cryo-arch, two thirds of the population would escape the crossfire while the rest were put to the stake by Ludd fanatics for worshipping the \"demonic autofactory\".\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿They tried to rebuild their life in a remote system, away from the core worlds Collapse, but circomstances always seems to pull them back, always forcing them[/i][i] to take further extremes measures to ensure their survival.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]0-ooC-pgCFI[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿This faction mixes all techs in a melting pot of advanced engineering craziness, producing ships and weapons unlike any others.

On the other hand they have slightly more fragile hulls, narrow shields, terrible flux dissipation (relying on venting instead) and fewer weapon mounts. They have to rely on wolf pack tactics to kill isolated targets while the bigger enemies are tied up pursuing smaller prey. Their weapons usually have worse range than vanilla one but superior damage, making even the smallest ship a potential threat if left completely unchecked. When pursued however, they can fold very quickly due to their exposed sides and low staying power.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]CONTENT SHOWCASE[/size][/u][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/d8SRBYG.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/zY39I6F.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=3][i][u]Bug Tracker and Feedback form[/u][/i]:[/size]\n<br />You have some feedback to share and want to make sure I do not miss it?

      "description": "[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/W4XZyF7.jpg[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br /> This ship pack provides a wide selection of more than 30 vessels that do not exactly match existing vanilla aesthetic or gameplay styles. They range from the uncommon and unconventional class to some properly rare (and expensive to deploy) super-ships. Still, everything should be balanced with proper strengths and weaknesses; including some new balancing levers such as exotic weapons interfering with each other, to avoid any power creep.\n<br />\n<br /> The intent here is to offer enough different \"white whales\" that you are both guaranteed to encounter several of them in any given run, yet each would be rare enough that you won't be able to collect them all in a single play-through. If you are using Nexerelin however, you will be able to start directly with some of the uncommon ships. I would even advise trying some of the very enjoyable \"player-bait\" destroyer starts.\n<br />\n<br />Small sample of the ships you might encounter:\n<br />[spoiler][center][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/iUEhFCw.png[/img][/center][b]Hedone-class armed yacht[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Gustav Royal Starworks' best selling premium yacht, ideal for the affluent needing to travel in comfort and security.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/8P1PEFo.png[/img][/center][b]Aethernium-class militarized racer[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Fast and economical courier that never walks away from a fair fight.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/DlaUV3b.png[/img][/center][b]Butterfly-class private security destroyer[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Makes up for its lack of versatility with raw frontal firepower.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/gPQMOS9.png[/img][/center][b]Five-five-seven-class bounty-hunter destroyer[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Flashy coat of paint, big gun that makes a big noise, daredevil attitude, badass in every way.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/kjBYejl.png[/img][/center][b]Obelisk-class luxury liner[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Guaranteed to impress your guests somehow, either with its ostentatious design and facilities, or with its massive gun.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/x2O8sFZ.png[/img][/center][b]Tumbleweed-class explorer[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Jack of all trades, master of none... \n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/30Vf2JC.png[/img][/center][b]Bullhorn-vlass heavy cruiser[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Slightly more agile and versatile than a Dominator-class, even more vulnerable to the rear.\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/GKaid06.png[/img][/center][b]Cassowary-class support battlecruiser[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The true nemesis of captains with OCD.[/center]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[size=3][i][u]Bug Tracker and Feedback form[/u][/i]:[/size]\n<br />You have some feedback to share and want to make sure I do not miss it?

Also adds a depletion tracker to the industry's tooltip, and improves on the story point upgrade.\n> Safe to add midgame (although will require rebuilding any Tech-Mining industries), however unfortunately not safe to remove.\nYou can find the download links here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706\n*Changelog:*\n- Fixed bug where decay tracker only showed 0% (parenthesis are important)\n- Fixed bug where in some situations decay would continue to apply even when industry was improved\n- Fixed bug where improvement text wouldn't account for cycle/set setting\n- Adjusted settings for a more reasonable experience\n\nYunru Industries also updated, but only with the above changes.",

Gets a full ASB compliment.\n    -T3 has supercharged ASB/Hellbores, Drive disruptors on attack modules, Ravelin drones, and a lowtech minefield.\n    -Speeen.\n    -Will only be applied to the Federation's homeworld in new games.\n    -Can build if rep with the Federation is at welcoming.\n\nRebellion-class Battleship\n    -System actually overloads the ship at low flux.\n    -Increased DP from 55 to 60.\n    -Shield efficiency nerf, 0.8 -> 0.9 flux/damage.\n    -Mod Rebellion DP increased to 60 (if it already wasn't).\n\n-Fixed Tarrifs, but only in new games.

      "description": "Stinger Shipyards aims to fill many combat roles not filled by both vanilla and most other mods. From missile cruisers to drone carrier, you're guaranteed to find something that fits your fleet.\n<br />\n<br />The mod has been reviewed by Moshi, check it out!\n<br />[youtube]A9_Jlxw5s-o[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />If you have any feedback, you can directly message me through discord, turkler#4348. Alternatively, you can find me in the [url=https://discord.gg/EWcH2P8JHv]Starport Corvus[/url] discord!\n<br />\n<br />List of ships, in the order of addition:\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Champion-class (c) Converted Battlecarrier -[/b] A carrier conversion of the baseline Champion hull, this modification gets rid of the large missile mount and two smaller front mounts in exchange of a fighter bay. The ship has been up-armored as well, even thought at the cost of acceleration and strafing speed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Lilim-class Missile Destroyer - [/b]The Lilim is a dedicated missile destroyer designed to provide a mobile platform for missile fire support. Being much more sluggish compared to other hulls of its size, the Lilim-class serves a great escort role as the hammer against the anvil. Despite the ship’s great performance as a support platform, it is rarely used in the post-Collapse sector due to the ship’s overbearing maintenance costs.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Lilith-class Missile Cruiser - [/b]A missile-focused cruiser with a Paladin Point Defense System built-into the hull. Like it's sister ship Lilim, it's impressive firepower is only held back by it's fragile hull and it's overbearing maintenance costs.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Brynhildr-class Missile Cruiser - [/b]An ancient ship pre-dating even the Onslaught-class battleships we see today, the Brynhildr is an ancient missile cruiser featuring robust construction and no modern shields. Instead, the Brynhildr is equipped with an integrated Damper Field of archaic design but tuned to modern standards. This allows the Brynhildr to shrug off what would otherwise be lethal damage during combat.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Tartarus-class Missile Frigate -[/b] A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the missile support it can provide along with its non-demanding support profile, the ancient Tartarus-class frigates pack a respectable amount of missile firepower. The ship’s suprising agility allows a wise commander to shift missile support to wherever it is needed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Laplace-class Proximity Support Destroyer -[/b] The Laplace is a rare, experimental hull developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation in an attempt to weaponize the relatively niche Proximity Charge Launcher. The ship includes a unique Heavy Proximity Charge Launcher built into the hull, along with ordnance assembly facilities that can rearm its unique weapons during extended deployments.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Adramelech-class Minelayer -[/b] The bigger sister of the Laplace-class, the Adramelech is a rare, experimental hull developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation in an attempt to weaponize the relatively weak Proximity Charge Launcher. The ship includes two unique Heavy Proximity Charge Launchers built into the hull, along with ordnance assembly facilities that can rearm its unique weapons during extended deployments. Vast amounts of hull space have been dedicated to the assembly and storage of the built-in phase mine deployment systems, leaving little room for other mounts.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Morrigan-class Mining Frigate -[/b] The Morrigan is a remarkably simple and reliable dedicated mining frigate. Multiple post-collapse combat upgrades have been installed aboard the nimble frigate, including a particularly exotic one which allows its hardcoded LPC mining drones to overload their reactors and disable range limiters to engage in kamikaze attacks.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Whiskey Pete-class Mining Auxiliary -[/b] The Whiskey Pete is a drone carrier designed to lead civilian mining operations. Featuring no modular fighter bays, the ship instead includes an array of drones designed to assist in cracking open asteroids which have been modified in cycles post-Collapse to assist during combat situations as well. Nonetheless, the Whiskey Pete is not a combat ship and works bests as a support ship behind the frontlines.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Perigee-class Destroyer -[/b] The Perigee-class vessel is an effective mix of advanced scientific and military technologies, perfect for long-range exploration of hostile space. The ship features relatively flexible weapon mounts, allowing the ship to fill whatever role is needed in combat engagements. Although the ship excels at support roles it is nonetheless capable at any other role it might be given.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Mora (DEMIL)-class Auxiliary Platform -[/b] An unmodified original civilian model before the Mora-class hulls were refitted into carriers, demilitarized variants of the Mora-class are still used by salvage crews and prospectors alike.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Starliner (S)-class Civilian Liner -[/b] An unmodified original civilian model in pristine stock condition, this ship is a collector's item from a more civilized age.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Jackass-class Combat Freighter  - [/b]An ancient combat superfreighter built to resupply fleets and outpost where combat engagements are expected. Being designed and built before the Colossus series of hulls, the ship lacks the efficiency and cost-effectiveness expected from freighters in the modern realities of the sector. Still, the ship's massive pressurized cargo holds are protected by heavy armor plating and an impressive amount of armaments letting the ship hold its own in combat, making it the ship a solid option for fleets requiring protection against the attention brought from transporting a large volume of cargo.\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'. The Stronghold drone is one of the heaviest drones deployed in drone units. Lacking most regular armament the Stronghold instead includes many missile-type weapon mounts to provide unmatched firepower in the few drone units which were expected to face the heaviest of resistance. Not being much more than a support platform meant that the Stronghold drones were anticipated to regularly be disabled in combat, so the heavy drone was designed with highly modular components which allowed badly damaged hulls to be rapidly cannibalized to repair lightly damaged hulls up to combat capacity without the need for shipyard facilities.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Along with new hulls, Stinger Shipyards introduces a new modular fighter wing into the sector as well:\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Peridot-class EMP Bomber - [/b]A technologically advanced fighter armed with a single Lapis Lazuli-class EMP torpedo. The payload is enough to knock out most weapon systems and severely cripple shield projectors.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also comes with a handful of new weapons;\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Mephisto CIWS Platform -[/b] A medium-range defensive weapon system that fires at an astonishing rate of a thousand rounds per minute. Standard ship armor is spaced and thus the small rounds fired from the Mephisto are only effective against small targets such as fighters and torpedoes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Spica Giga Launcher -[/b] A torpedo launcher designed to fire Giga-class torpedoes in two-round bursts. Makes up for its limited damage potentional with unmatched strike damage.\n<br />\n<br />[b]* Quadruple Giga - [/b]Quad launcher system capable of launching a devastating torpedo barrage. the Quadruple Giga-class torpedo platform offers a devastating four-launch burst of Giga-class torpedoes, but is held back by its hefty logistical profile and a disappointing damage potential during extended deployments due to a limited magazine size.",

It's a merger of basically of every anime-themed portrait pack I could find for Starsector merged into one pack, and just a little bit of curation to remove some of the more blatant outliers in quality/size/etc to make the art slightly more consistent.\n<br />[u]Why?[/u]\n<br />I've been modifying the portrait packs I downloaded to remove outliers in quality and size. Additionally, I've noticed many, perhaps most, mod packs only support vanilla factions and do not include support for most modded factions. I corrected this... but only after a lot of effort in figuring out how. I figured sharing it would save other users a similar struggle. And then I merged them together because I figured it's easier to have one big pack instead of many little ones.\n<br />[u]What's in it?[/u]\n<br />Contains elements from the following existing packs, with credits to their respective authors:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=12493.0]Degenerate Portrait Pack[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=17755.0]Kancolle Portrait Pack[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=15939.0]Girls Frontline Portrait Pack[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=17251.0]Azur Lane Portrait Packs[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=17251.msg293022#msg293022]Azur Lane Portraits Expansions[/url]\n<br />[*]Discord user Caymon Joestar#6574 GFL Portrait Expansion\n<br />[*]Discord user Lolibote#4700's Kancolle Portrait Expansion\n<br />[*]Discord user Lolibote#4700's Abyssal Portrait Expansion[/li][li]VNSector Portrait Pack\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[u]Customization Instructions[/u]\n<br />This mod will attempt to add the portraits to [u]every[/u] possible faction, including almost every mod in existence that's been updated to 0.9.1a.

      "description": "[b][center]﻿[/center][/b][b][center]﻿[/center][center][size=4]DOWNLOAD UNDER MIRRORS SINCE NEXUS WON'T LET ME UPLOAD[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/DEZURaj.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[size=4]Sylphon RnD[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />History[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Founded in a long-gone era, the Sylphon Institute for AI research was a small but leading institution in its field of research, making vast strides in the improvement and application of artificial intelligence. Decades of interaction with advanced alpha- and beta-level intelligences soon led to a unique culture within the growing institute as an ever increasing portion of members began accepting AIs as equal lifeforms and partners in their scientific endeavors. To avoid regulation, the institute built a new base of operations at the edge of the Persean Sector, reforming into the Sylphon Research and Development corporation. \n<br />\n<br />It was only 10 years later that the catastrophic events of the collapse shattered the human Domain and cast the sector into an age of strife. Having only just finished construction of the most essential geofronts deep below the surface of the frozen world of Castrum and still lacking the ability to be self-sufficient, Sylphon entered into a contract with the aspiring Tri-Tachyon corporation, giving them the necessary stability to finish construction of the remaining necessary facilities in exchange for their expertise in AI technology. While this course of action raised many moral concerns within the board of directors, at this point composed of humans and AI equally, it was ultimately deemed necessary for the survival of Sylphon.\n<br />\n<br />Staying under the radar in the following decades, Sylphon achieved self-sufficiency while avoiding political involvement in the chaotic post-collapse years. Having established themselves as a reliable think-tank and technical service provider, the young corporation entered into a multitude of contracts with most of the newly-established sector powers, assisting with anything from logistical planning to major military fleet refits.\n<br />\n<br />Unknown to most, however, was a fortunate discovery by a Sylphon exploratory vessel at the edge of the event horizon of a black hole beyond explored space. An anomaly seemingly never encountered before by mankind, this black rift in space, sprakling with eerie purple lights, opened Nullspace to Sylphon. Bringing with it countless new technological applications, this discovery catapulted the small corporation into a technological renaissance.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Nullspace and Nulltech[/b]\n<br />\n<br />A new pocket-dimension discovered by Sylphon, this dark void seems to be filled with an endless nothingness and not by accident. Governed by a powerful counterforce, Nullspace seeks to eject anything that enters it, be it solid mass or even any form of energy. This counterforce exponentially grows as long as an entity remains within nullspace trying to enter nullspace unprepared would rip even the sturdiest warships apart.\n<br />\n<br />Using a special conduit technology, Sylphon vessels are capable of channeling this counterforce into a temporarily controllable stream of chaotic energies, enabling them to skim or even fully enter nullspace for extended periods of time.\n<br />\n<br />Space within nullspace appears to be uniquely distorted, accelerating all motion within it without affecting the flow of time like p-space.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features[/b]\n<br />- High Tech ships that like to fight up close and personal -\n<br />- Unique nulltech-based mobility systems, designed to reposition and flank rather than hit and run -\n<br />- A series of armored high tech ships capable of parrying incoming fire to recharge their shields -\n<br />- New energy and missile weapons with unique quirks -\n<br />- Two new systems on the edge of the sector with more to come -\n<br />- The pink planetbuster laser you've always wanted -\n<br />- Glorious purple spaceships -\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Gameplay hints[/b]\n<br />- While a high tech faction, Sylphon ships are for the majority designed to stay in the fight\n<br />- The Dread Eagle is a powerful flanker, but its teleport has a long cooldown and can get it in sticky situations\n<br />- Sylphon missiles are designed to fill unique roles and aren't a replacement for vanilla missiles\n<br />- Nanolaminate Armor ships can use their ship system to \"parry\" strong incoming fire\n<br />- Weapon flux per second displayed in outfitting does not take into account the flux discount from the integrated nullspace conduit hullmod\n<br />- With a number of fully automated ships and drone fighters, Sylphon fleet aren't very crew-intensive, but this comes at cost of supply efficiency",

It's possible, for example, to have up to three Radiants in your fleet without suffering any CR maluses. The drawback is an increase in the amount monthly supplies required to keep your ships operational. You'll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I'm open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.2 changelog\n```\n- Fixed NullPointer error when loading the game\n- (Hopefully) fixed negative ship weight bug\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

This faction is formally known as the Tyrador Safeguard Coalition, or colloquially, as the Coalition.\n<br />The mod itself tries to introduce a \"Forge World\" fantasy into the game, where the Coalition faction is centered around a single heavily populated industrialized planet, in a heavily defended system.\n<br />And meanwhile the faction was not an interstellar megacorporation like the Tri-Tachyon, it surely was the home of several innovations, some of these creations being retconned to before the fall of the domain, as such many of the ships added by the mod have some vanilla faction skins, specially Tri-Tachyon skins, since the \"natives\" would have worked closely with them.\n<br />Style wise, the faction ships, overall, are flavored between midline and hightech, leaning more closely to the later.\n<br />In regards to gameplay, the faction is pretty much focused in larger ships, where destroyers and smaller vessels are mostly relegated to support functions. Many of the ships have severe downfalls, requiring the player to deploy well balanced fleets into battle. The exception to this is capital vessels, which are quite capable on their own.\n<br />The mod also adds a new kind of weapon, known as drone spawners, this type of weaponry enables a ship to provide a constant stream of highly disposable drones, that act similarly to standard fighters.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Ship Catalog:[/b]\n<br />[center][img]https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1VXnMrWJWUU4C6iik6F62nW0jNjfio2Le[/img][/center]\n<br /> \n<br />[b]Technology:[/b]\n<br />[center][img]https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1Qncr8fQSNeI57W2diWaBeoAzEsDmPoo2[/img][/center]",

In general, I've tried to make Rebal compatible with Faction mods, etc., but YMMV.\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][center][font=Verdana]Mod Pack Components[/font][/center][/size][center][font=Verdana][size=4]Starsector Rebal[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Rebal focuses on rebalancing the combat and non-combat parts of the game to support diversity in play styles and character concepts.\n<br />[*]Rebal also includes many innovative sub-systems for modders to use, such as the Special Shot System, Beam / Energy mechanics, shield / flux systems, etc.\n<br />[*]A detailed summary of Rebal’s changes to gameplay is further below.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=4]Starsector AI Overhaul (MT)[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]AI Overhaul is an AI replacer for most core functions of the Starsector AI, utilizing multithreaded Java so that AI can run on multiple CPUs at once.\n<br />[*]AI Overhaul is not 100% compatible with all modded AIs that rely on certain AI-Flag combinations, but is designed to be generally compatible, and it features a blacklisting system, for mods where it isn't suitable.\n<br />[*]AI Overhaul also includes sub-AI for weapons, including turret controls (auto-aim) and missile guidance.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=4]Starsector FX (MT)[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]FX consists of two parts: a core Utility mod and an example project specifically designed to support Rebal.\n<br />[*]The core Utility mod is designed for modders, and does nothing on its own.  It is a multithreaded Java utility for building particle effects and trails with powerful tools for modders to use. ﻿\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][font=Verdana][center]﻿EZ Faction﻿[/center][/font][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]EZ Faction is a Utility mod that makes building Faction mods as easy as possible, yet powerful enough for most modders. \n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=4]EZ Damage[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] EZ Damage is a Utility mod that makes applying generic damage effects to a ship or CombatEntityAPI one line of code.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=4]Explorer Society[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Explorer Society is a basic Faction mod included with the Mod Pack to demonstrate EZ Faction, EZ Damage, FX, etc. in the context of Rebal.  Explorer Society explicitly depends on Rebal being installed to use, as it shares some systems.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=5]Rebal Mod Change List[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />It’s almost impossible to succinctly summarize all of the core mechanic changes in Rebal, but this is an overview.\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=4]﻿Starting selections have been changed to reflect the style of gameplay they represent.[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Wolf start now includes a Scarab and a Dram. This is intended to be a “hard combat start”.\n<br />[*]The Wayfarer is now a “trader” start, it now comes with a Mule, Tarsus, and a Dram, as well as some random goods to allow for the player to begin trading while in Galatia.\n<br />[*]The “explorer” start has been rebalanced a bit to work better with the new combat systems.\n<br />[*]The “mercenary” start has been rebalanced slightly.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[center][font=Verdana][size=4]Travel speed has been increased in general, especially in hyperspace.[/size][/font][/center]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Burn speed is now considerably faster than vanilla's default.  As a result, Sustained Burn is now significantly faster.\n<br />[*]The eminently abusable Transverse Jump has been replaced with Hyper Jump.  This new ability allows the player to instantly traverse large sections of hyperspace nearly instantly... but it costs a lot of Fuel.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Tariffs have been changed to fit the theme of each faction.[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Hegemony:  Low (20%)\n<br />[*]Luddic Church: Very High (40%)\n<br />[*]Knights of Lud: High(35%)\n<br />[*]Ludic Path:  Very Low(10%)\n<br />[*]Persean League:  Low(15%)\n<br />[*]Sindrian Diktat:  Moderate(25%)\n<br />[*]Lions Guard: Moderate(25%)\n<br />[*]Tri-Tachyon: Low(15%)\n<br />[*]Independent: Very Low(10%)\n<br />[*]The Explorer Society: Very Low(10%)\n<br />[*]Pirates:  Very Low (5%)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />It doesn't make sense that all of the Factions uniformly agreed on a 30% tariff and uniformly agreed to keep legitimate trade away from their planets.  This has never made much sense, nor has the lack of genuine trade routes.  So, in general, tariffs have been lowered, to increase the incentive the player has to trade [i]100% legally[/i] with several of the Factions (including the Pirates).  It should be possible to raise one’s Reputation with the Pirates through legitimate trade runs and Missions and even &lt;ahem&gt; make a living as a Pirate.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Experience gain is much faster than Vanilla, to reduce time spent grinding.[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />Grinding in Starsector is largely wasted time, after a few runs through the game.  I want to get to the fun parts where I get to bash giant fleets together... don’t you?\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Money gained from most major Intel activities / Missions is increased substantially.[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />This includes income from bounties, exploration, and trade missions.  Bounty missions are far more common, so that players aren’t ever waiting for one to populate.\n<br />\n<br />To help balance this increase of income, expenses are increased as well.  This includes monthly maintenance, Officer pay, and Crew / Marine pay.  On the high end, this means that fleets can cost ruinous amounts to maintain.  Players will need to balance their need for firepower against their budgets.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Factions are NOT fully dynamic like they were in Vacuum (yet).[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />This mod [i]does not[/i] replace Nexerelin’s functions or implement the full features of Vacuum (my previous, barely-lamented mega-mod TC).  Dynamic behaviors will [i]probably[/i] be added when Alex releases the next major build of the game, if Alex doesn't get around to it (which, based on his latest comments, he probably won't).\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Player fleets are allowed to be much larger than vanilla.[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Player fleets can be as large as 90 ships.\n<br />[*]AI fleets can be as large as 180 ships.\n<br />[*]Giant fleets to bash against aren't happening... yet.  This is on my list for late-game tweaks.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Level caps and Skills have been adjusted.[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Player level cap is 80, giving access to more Skills (but not quite all).\n<br />[*]Combat Skills also give fleet-wide buffs at level 3.  WARNING: this means that the AI can have a [i]significant[/i] advantage if the player does not invest in Combat.\n<br />[*]Officer level cap is now 29.  This allows Officers to max out 10 skills fully, rather than missing points or not filling out their Skill bar.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Shields and Flux[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Shields have their base damage-resistance value tied directly to their arc, in degrees.  A small-arc shield is nearly invulnerable to enemy fire, but will not protect the entire ship, whereas a Bubble Shield provides complete protection, but with considerably less resistance.\n<br />[*]Form Shields offer players a new shield type that has some major weaknesses and strengths.  Form Shields go up / down instantly and are, as the name suggests, form-fitting, reducing a ship’s hitbox.  However, they are vulnerable to Fragmentation and EMP damage and don’t benefit as much as conventional shields from Skills and Hull Mods.\n<br />[*]Hard Flux drains constantly, based on Capacity.  This is a passive ability that all ships have now.\n<br />[*]Other Hard Flux mitigation tools are widely available.\n<br />[*]Many ships that were widely-perceived as “shield tanks” are more effective in Rebal in their theme.\n<br />[*]There are no shield-less ships in Rebal.  Even Pirate “trash” ships have some shielding.  In some cases, this means certain ships are considerably improved over their Vanilla versions.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Weapons Changes[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Weapon stats have been extensively altered, across the board, using a balancing system where all weapons have been par-balanced versus their cost in Ordinance Points.  This isn’t 100% perfect, but weapon balance is generally better than in Vanilla; there aren’t “trash guns” or other newbie-traps.\n<br />[*]Beams do Hard Flux damage, and do more damage the closer they are to targets.  After extensive testing of alternatives, this appears to be the best way to fix Beam balance.  Certain Beams have had their ranges reduced to compensate.\n<br />[*]Energy Damage weapons do more damage the closer they are to targets.\n<br />[*]Missile weapons all reload, and do not run out of ammo.\n<br />[*]Certain Vanilla weapons have new behaviors (for example, the Thumper is now an efficient “shotgun” that kills fighters well).\n<br />[*]Friendly Fire is no longer a thing.  The performance implications of Friendly Fire for the AI far outweigh the small problems it creates for players and AI ships occasionally using each other as cover.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Hull Mods[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Most Hull Mods cost fewer OPs.\n<br />[*]Lots of Hull Mods have had their effects tweaked, sometimes in radical ways.  For example, Rapid Venting gives players a small boost to passive Flux drain, as well as improving Venting speeds.  Ion Shielding gives ships a big improvement in resistance to Beams, etc.\n<br />[*]As a result of the above changes, ships tend to have a much broader selection of Hull Mods and many different ship builds are viable that weren’t really available in Vanilla.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Ship Changes[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]In general, ships are a little more-firmly placed in their size class.  For example, there are no Destroyers who are faster than Frigates, there are no Frigates faster than Fighters, and so on.\n<br />[*]In general, the larger ships have considerably-higher values for Armor, Hull Points and Flux stats.  Larger ships can tank more damage than in Vanilla, in general.  The difference in stats between Capital-class ships and Cruisers has been made a little sharper; a Capital-class ship is usually capable of destroying multiple smaller vessels by itself in late-game play.\n<br />[*]In general, Fighters are still strong, but not as strong overall as they are in Vanilla (as of 0.91a).  Carrier-only fleets generally don’t work as well, but Fighters are a strong, viable supporting element.\n<br />[*]Some ships, particularly Destroyers, are geared for player use while being somewhat viable for the AI.  Destroyers are the “sweet spot” between effective combat power and maneuverability in Starsector, and I’ve tried to make some of them feel very special for players who want to have a ship designed for hands-on play.\n<br />[*]For players who prefer a more tactical role as commander, rather than as a fighter, the larger ships are very suitable for this style of play.  Taking command of an Onslaught that forms the core of your fleet should feel like a valid choice, even if you’re just giving directions occasionally.\n<br />[*]Expert players, who want to do both piloting and fleet direction in combat, will be amply rewarded.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Verdana][size=4][center]Other Notes[/center][/size][/font]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*] Rebal is a work-in-progress; it has changed many times as my understanding of what might work best has altered.  This build represents where it is today.  It’s not 100% perfect, but I think it’s generally Fun and improves certain aspects of Starsector, both early and late-game play.\n<br />[*]I’ve tested FX with multiple computers / GPUs; it should be broadly compatible with most people’s hardware, as it uses very basic OpenGL to do the final drawing of the sprites.\n<br />[*]The AI mod does not behave like Vanilla’s AI.  This isn’t a bug, it’s a feature.  Getting used to how it works in specific ways (for example, Fighters don’t have an artificial range limit from carriers) takes time.  Be patient and try different ship builds out to see how it works.\n<br />[*]Rebal’s mechanics are mainly geared for late-game combat builds, where I feel that Starsector is too reliant on artificial limits and game-mechanics that limit both players and the AI.  In Rebal, players can build vastly-powerful fleets; the problem is largely, “how do I pay for that killer fleet” rather than, “I cannot really build a fleet that can take multiple Pirate Armadas”.  The change in emphasis on Combat Skills to include fleet-wide buffs largely addresses the power-imbalance between players and the AI in late-game, where AI fleets, being less carefully-optimized, start having major problems competing.  In Rebal, the player is forced to either put points into all of the Combat tree skills, or face opponents who may have small (but significant) advantages.\n<br />[*]Rebal and the other mods together mean that large-scale battles with the AI scale well and perform very well; this is how I like to play Starsector, with giant battles between epic-scale fleets.  I will probably make this emphasis even stronger in the future.\n<br />[/list]",

      "description": "Nobody saw that.\n\nNot save compatible with ***any*** previous versions of the mod.\n\nForeword:\nSo as far as I'm concerned, this mod is now finished. I needed to remove the mod's modularity because hidden modular hardpoints kept breaking other people's mods. As a result, removing the loadout flexibility was a necessary step, as the weapon sprites covered all of the actual ship. It was a necessary step for functionality, but with my own level of skill, I wouldn't be able to preserve my original vision for the mod by doing any decoration weapon wizardry.\n\nSo it was a lot of fun, and I don't regret my time spent on this little endeavour, but this is the final update for SIMP, barring any catastrophic issues that need immediate resolution.\n\nThe tl;dr:\n-Requires Arma Armatura and its dependencies to work.\n-Adds six strikecraft and five fighters.\n-Safe to add, can't verify whether safe to remove.\n\nChanges this patch:\n-All ships have built-in, pre-selected weapon loadouts now.\n-All ships now generate no weapon flux.\n-Flux values drastically reduced to accommodate for weapons no longer creating flux. Flux values are for shields only, now.\n\nChanges last patch:\n-Brought DP costs slightly back up, and increased wing OP costs as well. Even after the rework, they're still way stronger than vanilla fighters, and those values should reflect that. \n\nCredits/Shoutouts:\n-Shoi for designing ARMAA and making this project possible in the first place.\n-CenturionChet for inspiring me to go down this rabbithole  by making his own mod first.\n-Tibby for thinking my kitbashed sprites are cute.\n-Amazigh for advising me about kitbashing's viability when I was initially struggling with spriting.\n-Doogydong for advice on balance revolving around the Raphus.\n-Lavoroxan for more advice around balancing the mod in general!\n-Quartofel for doling out advice as well.\n-Anyone else whose usernames I can't recall off the top of my head, who helped me with my many, many questions.\n-And the entire community. Thank you.",

(Note: Misc got split into Higher Tech, Old School, and Civ)***\n\nHigher Tech Expansion:\n> Escort frigates, frontline shield-tanks, minelayers, and more!\n\nMidline Expansion:\n> Dedicated missiles ships, a wider expanse of broadsiders, support frigates, and more!\n\nOld School Expansion:\n> Bricky ships, take a beating, keep on... beating.\n\nPirates and Pathers:\n> Pirate ships \"designed\" by throwing together whatever salvage was at hand, with a bare minimum threshold for being put into active service, as they are want to do.\n> Blessed ships anointed to carry out Ludd's will. Inevitable involves explosions.\n\nCivilian Utilities and Navigational Technologies:\n> Capital-class personnel carriers, exploration cruisers that can achieve parity with military ships when themselves militarised, etc.\n\nHullmods:\n> More hullmods to further customise and specialise your ships with, scattered across the sector and it's factions.\n> \"Install\" hullmods that permanently modify your ship in various ways.\n> AI core integration, unlocking its own set of powerful hullmods to arm your ships with, scaling in power based on the level of core.\n\nArsenal:\n> A collection of weapons that I thought would be interesting. Balance is probably wonky both up and down, as I've yet to establish a testing practice that I find works for me, but should still be fun.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

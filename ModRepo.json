      "description": "Forum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21280.0\nDownload: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/releases\n\nThis mod gives you more control over the way weapon groups behave when on autofire. For each weapon group, you can select one or more tags, such as e.g. holding fire when flux > X% or avoiding shields, to customise how that group should behave. Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux > 50%) and two ~~badly~~  expertly done GUIs.\nCan be added/removed/updated to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\n1.6.0 fixes some minor issues, adds two new tags (Range<N% and ShipTarget) and makes the combat GUI lib usable for mod authors (cf. https://github.com/DesperatePeter/test-combat-gui-lib)\n\nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: Instead of suggested modes/suffixes, you can now list suggested tags for your weapons in modSettings.json. If you had already added weapon modes/suffxies, feel free to leave them in for compatibility  with older versions.  (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/master/data/config/modSettings.json#L16 for an example). \nFor details on how to add tags to enemy ships: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control#assigning-tags-to-enemy-ship-weapons\n\nPlease let me know if you encounter any issues or have some feedback!\n\nThanks in advance and happy gaming/modding!",

      "description": "Bugfix and some small balance changes.\n\n- Lacerta: Increased max flux (2500 -> 3000) to bring its effective HP more in line with other high-end frigates.\n- Tachyon Drivers: Increased range by 200, to 700/800 for the small/medium. Removed magazine system from small. Increased re-fire time to 1.5 sec. Excellent range for energy weapons, but poor projectile velocity and armor penetration. Useful for ships that want to rangematch ballistics with energies.\n- Reworked the \"add to existing save\" functionality, hopefully fixing a rare bug that could cause Apex to reset its relations with other factions when in Nex's random core worlds mode.\n\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22704.0\nDownload: https://github.com/theDragn/ApexDesignCollective/releases/download/1.0.0/Apex.Design.Collective_1.0.7.zip",

Adds a line of special low-tech \"Ancient Secrets\" ships to the Appro-Light fleet lineup, special ship variants as reward for doing missions for Truth Originem, and the Knights Arbiter boss faction.\nLike the above, this is an unofficial translation, so any issues should be directed to me.\nWhat's New:\n```\nLike with the main Appro-Light, there have been a large number of sprite updates and balance changes.\n2 new Ancient Secrets ships and 1 new weapon, as well as 1 new Appro-Light - Full Spirit ship.\nAll Primus Arborea ships (barring the Crown) have been removed.\n```\nUPDATE: AL+ is fixed now\nDownload link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yWBFtmOV3CrfEqjiGPzmWLzl_5mapGsT/view?usp=sharing",

I listen to everything thrown my way.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/wRXW1uV.png[/img]\n<br />[color=green]broadcasting AI overrides. rendezvous co-ordinates set.[/color][/center]",

Every ship has a built-in boost to active flux vent rate, meaning they can easily reset flux if given a breather: something you'll want to be doing often, due to mediocre shields and armor.\n<br />\n<br />Most of the faction's warships are excellent at crushing valuable targets and picking apart slow, but powerful foes. On the other hand, they struggle in fights where they can't find any breathing room for hit-and-run attacks, or against a numerically superior enemy that can flank and surround them. Using the faction's weapons, ships can be built for either high risk/high reward play, or low risk/low reward play. Certain ships break the mold and afford different playstyles.",

How close they are to the radar's center depends on the current zoom level. Zoom is controlled with [b]+/-[/b].\n<br />[*][b]Ships[/b] are drawn as solid-colored shapes. Phased ships will appear faded on the radar, and your ship's current target will have a white marker drawn around it.\n<br />[*][b]Shields[/b] will have their active arcs shown in blue.\n<br />[*][b]Missiles[/b] are small colored dots; purple for enemy missiles, dark green for allied ones. \n<br />The brightness of the dot varies based on how much damage that missile deals, so an Atropos torpedo (2,000 damage) is much more noticeable than an Annihilator swarm (200 damage each). Missiles that are locked onto the player ship are colored orange. Missiles that have burnt out are considered enemies as they can hit either side at that point.[*][b]Missile lock status[/b] is displayed at the top left of the radar box. If any guided missiles are in view and locked onto the player \n<br />ship, an orange missile icon will appear here. The brightness of this icon depends on the most threatening missile currently locked on.[*][b]Asteroids[/b] are small white dots.\n<br />[*][b]Objectives[/b] are large hollow diamonds.\n<br />[*][b]Retreat areas[/b] are shaded yellow.\n<br />[*][b]Map borders[/b] are shown as red lines, with a gray void beyond to show inaccessible areas.\n<br />[*][b]Combat readiness[/b] for the player ship is shown as a vertical bar to the right of the radar. Current CR is shown in [b][color=#00ffff]cyan[/color][/b], CR lost in the current battle in [b][color=#0000ff]dark blue[/color][/b], and unobtained CR in [b][color=#404040]dark gray[/color][/b]. The bar will slowly flash if you are currently losing CR and flash \n<br />faster as malfunction risk rises. For ships that don't lose CR this bar will be faded to be less obtrusive. If you are playing in campaign, your ship's maximum CR given the current captain and crew is shown as a horizontal white line.[*][b]Battle progress[/b] is shown as a bar along the bottom of the radar. It's based on the fleet points remaining on each side, so the larger the \n<br />green portion is, the closer to victory you are. Allied ships are shown as a darker portion of each side's bar. A side's portion of the bar will flash if they are in full retreat. The relative fleet strengths at battle start is shown as a vertical white line so you can quickly tell if you're doing better than your opponent.[/list]",

Look out for special, hardened warning beacons with unique intel icons.\n<br />[spoiler=Blade Breaker Ships]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/58dN0rx.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Spearhead[/b][/i] - [i][b]Warlock[/b][/i] - [i][b]Black Lancer[/b][/i] - [i][b]Imp[/b][/i]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/XhM70bh.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Black Hand[/b][/i] - [i][b]Devil Ray[/b][/i] - [i][b]Sparrowhawk[/b][/i] - [i][b]Curse[/b][/i] - [i][b]Snake Eye[/b][/i] \n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/2ilh3tP.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Lycosid[/b][/i] - [i][b]Iridium[/b][/i] - [i][b]Hellion[/b][/i] - [i][b]Focuser[/b][/i] - [i][b]Firespray[/b][/i]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[spoiler=Blade Breaker Weapons]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/PEaIeZN.png[/img]\n<br />[i]Shellback AC[/i] - [i]Electron Bolt Projector[/i] - [i]Shellshocker Magnacannon[/i] - [i]Shell Hawk UAC[/i] - [i]Slicer HMG[/i]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/HfnhaJ0.png[/img]\n<br />[i]Smart-Plasmid Mortar[/i] - [i]Heavy Plasma Bolter[/i] - [i]Plasma Bolter[/i] - [i]Plasma Scatter PD[/i]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/rFPkmXX.png[/img]\n<br />[i]Degeneration Cycler[/i] - [i]Twinjack Burst Slicer[/i] - [i]Jackal Burst Slicer[/i][/spoiler]\n<br />[spoiler=Blade Breaker Campaign Entities]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/KhkUYLh.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Mining[/b] Base[/i] - [i][b]Research[/b] Base[/i] - [i][b]Training[/b] Base[/i]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/d9sUQ4j.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Acolyte[/b][/i] - [i][b]Preceptor[/b][/i]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/yWuAX1b.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Secure[/b] Data Storage[/i]\n<br />(implementation pending)[/spoiler]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/4gIbqNc.png[/img]\n<br />[i][b]Sigma Tech Blueprint[/b][/i]\n<br />And keep a look out for a [b]deserter[/b] from their ranks - you never know what goodies they might bring with them...

The subtility they add is that their ships are generally individually slightly inferior to Vanilla ones, but synergize very well with their wings of Wanzers: mech-like strike-crafts that pack a superior punch but susceptible to enemy fire. To help them carry their missions, most ships tend to saturate the enemy's PD with swarms of micro-missiles.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿A typical successful engagement against Diable Avionics fleets generally requires a solid phalanx of anti-fighter weapons to break the initial Wanzer and missile waves and a decisive counter-strike while their carriers are still rebuilding their strike-craft support. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]CONTENT SHOWCASE[/size][/u][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[center][spoiler][url=https://i.imgur.com/hX9ZSQH.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/hX9ZSQHh.jpg[/img][/url][/spoiler][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Features advanced transforming ships:\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/xuaQHch.gif[/img]    [img]http://i.imgur.com/XVMGrtC.gif[/img]    [img]https://i.imgur.com/GG7XXH7.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]ALTERNATIVE SKIN MODS[/size][/u][/i]\n<br />\n<br />Customize your fleet using one of [url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/44573931]these alternative skin pack mods.[/url] Only activate one in the launcher along with the main mod, you can swap them as often as you want without issue.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://imgur.com/a/JIYc9nQ]Here are some resources to easily make your own custom skin![/url] I eagerly await to see what others may come up with for custom paint jobs.

      "description": "Ever felt the Sindrian Diktat was too weak as a faction? Ever wanted to see it actually do anything in Nexerelin games without flopping and dying as soon as another faction remembers it exists?\n\nWell look no further! This mod considerably buffs up the Sindrian Diktat to somewhere between Tri-Tachyon and PL/Hegemony level of size and power. Unfortunately no ships are added since other mods(SWP, Ludd and Lions) have already added those, however this mod instead gives them a new system and new markets.\n\nNow also giving some love to Tri-Tachyon(maybe a bit too much love).\n\nNow compatible with PAGSM(hopefully).\n\n**Partially save compatible - Won’t crash your game if loaded in the midst of a save, but many features(primarily markets) will not be applied to the existing savegame**\n\n**Requires Nexerelin**\n\n```\nChanges:\n- Compatibility update with PAGSM, added markets now have different descriptions when PAGSM is used(highly recommended to be used with an upcoming PAGSM compatibility update for DE)\n- Compatibility update with 0.95.1a-RC6\n```\n\n**Download Below**",

Moderate testing suggests a ~25% increase in performance in large battles with many fighter/ships, your mileage may vary.\n> Crisp 😩 👌 and smooth engine visual\n\nCaveats:\n> Does not affect missile engines, they will still use vanilla behaviour. Engine colour changing has been implemented for Safety Overrides, Plasma Jets and Plasma Burn, however any other modded effects will not take effect because it is hardcoded, this is not fixable unfortunately.\n**Download:** https://github.com/automatopaste/fast-engine-rendering/releases/download/v1.1.0/FastEngineRendering_v1.1.0.zip",

Brought to you lovingly after a week of testing.\n\n```\nPacks Included:\n- JRE7 Safe Pack\n- JRE8 Safe/Aggresive/Dangerous Pack\n- For 1/2/3/4/6/8GB\n- G1GC Hide Leak Messages mods\n```\n\nKey differences between packs\nAll share the same trait of having a low latency multi-threaded GC (the janitor you may call it) to reclaim unused memory and make the game smooth. For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who're curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn't launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you're using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.4 Changes*\n\n-Both Fang and Draco have had their markets beefed up, and their faction stats overhauled.\n-Added spicy boss-ish fleets to Phylum and Prestor John systems.\n-Added Two MagicBounties, giving you a chance to find and use some truly despicable boats.\n-Fiddled with a lot of the stats.\n-Lots of tiny little fixes.\n\n*Savegame Compatible, but beyond the MagicBounties you won't see new stuff without a new game*\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_4.zip",

A lot of weapons have been completely redone in form and function, and just about everything has been tweaked.\n-Added a *lot* more weapons to fill some niches.\n-Added two new techmined fighters; a heavy, powerful fighter and a high-tech antimatter bomber.\n\n-Removed Decimator (Normal, P and LC versions); this ship has been replaced with the Vanguard.\n-Removed the Finch (No one remembers this).\n-Removed the Drone Firing system from the Whiskey Priest and Donkey due to rare CTD crash, instead they have dedicated suicide drone wings.\n-Bombardment Pod no longer fires Annhiliators. Instead, it fires *itself*.\n\n-Rejigged how HMI ships and weapons show up; they should be less common in Scavenger, Independent and Pirate fleets. Hopefully. Maybe?\n-Reworked HMI variants.\n-Fixed a lot of other minor problems + mis-spellings in HMI\n\n**Hotfix 0.3.5a**\n-Fixed the Scale not using the right weapons.\n\n**Update 0.3.5b**\n-Added 3 new weapons (Chances some of these will be cut from next version)\n-Fiddled with a couple of stats and visuals\n-Added six new Me[REDACTED] ships\n-Added The Third Phase for the [REDACTED] station fight (WIP)\n\nDownload NOT SAVE GAME COMPATIBLE (EXCEPT WITH PREVIOUS ALPHA VERSION) version here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/naa129p80uv1ft4/HMI_0_3_5b.zip?dl=1\n\nPlease give me a yell if anything goes wrong.",

Big, slow, expensive, and tanky, this is more of a lowtech ship than some lowtech ships. System is Microvent Actuators, which causes the ship to vent with a 50% dissipation bonus for a very brief period.\n\nChanges:\n- Bombardier: Sprite rework, courtesy of <@184002614986407936>. Everyone say \"thanks, Demto\".\n- Blaze Phase Fighter: moved from rare blueprint pool to hightech package, actually added auto_fighter tag this time around.\n- Equality: Minor sprite improvements (I forgot who did this but it wasn't me)\n- Fissure LRM: Reduced kinetic spike damage to 500; with the 0.95.1 buff to breaches this should push it further into a long-range armor stripping role. Reduced ammo regen.\n\n(this time I actually put the variants in there, whoops)\n\nDownload: https://github.com/theDragn/HTE/releases/download/1.4.9/HTE_1.4.9.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19548.0",

      "description": "[b][i]god rest the theocrats, c+00 (est.) - c+196.10.17[/i][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Born from the unlikely alliance of two traditionally opposed colonies who banded together during the Collapse to seize their independence from the Domain of Man; the cult-colonies of the Kadur Theocracy were once a great power in the Persean Sector with their own native shipbuilding industry and a powerful spaceborne navy. But now the theocrats are no more -- murdered along with millions of the Kadur people in a brutal conflict which saw the garden world Oasis, the jewel of the Mirage system, seized by the Hegemony and Kadur itself devastated by a Planet Killer-class virus bomb. Now the Kadur Remnant skulk the fringes of the sector in a captured Domain-era orbital fortress and the derelict wreckage of their once-great fleet, fighting a desperate battle for the continued survival of their people.\n<br />\n<br />The faith shared by all Kadur people is still deeply ingrained in every part of their culture, but where the Theocracy was inflexible and hierarchical, the Remnant is decentralized and fluid. Their shared beliefs have grown less dogmatic; focused more now on the connection between individuals forged through mutual hardship, and less on the divine right to power claimed in years past by their religious leaders. The Kadur people remain staunchly independent isolationists, regarding other factions with at best a wary suspicion born from centuries of mutual distrust, but have begun to make some diplomatic connections with other political players in the sector who are hostile to the Hegemony.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The Kadur Remnant, a remote isolationist faction of refugees and vengeance-seeking holy warriors\n<br />[*]Exerelin and Dynasector compatibility\n<br />[*]2 new star systems\n<br />[*]New ships and weapons for vanilla factions as well as the Kadur themselves\n<br />[*]\"ship pack only\" mode option to disable the Kadur faction and new star systems; only including the vanilla faction ships/weapons\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Gameplay information:[/b]\n<br />The Kadur Theocracy's fleet doctrine was heavily focused on long-range gunline bombardment, faring best when the enemy is kept at arm's length where the Kadur ships can safely catch shots with their otherwise inefficient shields and return fire with their long-range batteries, backing off to vent flux between volleys. However, since the fall of Kadur itself some warriors of the Kadur Remnant have adopted more aggressive tactics, quickly closing the distance to their enemies and overpowering them with close-range firepower before their weak shields and lack of maneuverability can be exploited.\n<br /> \n<br />Despite sturdy construction and armor, Kadur vessels don't have the durability to stand in the line of fire, and while their focused drive units provide excellent straight-line speed they [i]certainly[/i] don't have the mobility to get themselves out of trouble. They do excel at chasing down fleeing enemies or dashing in to open a gap in enemy lines -- as long as they're careful not to misjudge their opponent's strength and overextend.\n<br />\n<br />[b]A short guide to playing Kadur ships:[/b]\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/1BzXWRi.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />To summarize:\n<br />[b]Faction strengths:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]High speed\n<br />[*]High alpha strike damage\n<br />[*]Long-ranged weapons\n<br />[*]High hull strength and armor\n<br />[*]High mass\n<br />[*]Good forward-facing firepower\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Faction weaknesses:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Inefficient and front-fixed shields\n<br />[*]Poor maneuverability including acceleration and deceleration\n<br />[*]No energy weapons\n<br />[*]Mediocre point defense\n<br />[*]Mostly support missiles\n<br />[*]Exposed engines and few rear-facing weapons\n<br />[/list]",

      "description": "[center][b][u][size=5]The Anarakis Reparations Society[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/eug9Jdu.png[/img]﻿\n<br />\n<br />If fragmented and incomplete records are to be believed, the Anarakis Reparations Society was originally little more than a band of anti war protesters dating back to the earliest days of mankind's conquest of space. This notion seems almost disingenuous, as the organization that exists today is made up of some of the least trustworthy people to be found anywhere in the Persean Sector. Filling their coffers with pirated goods for some unknown end, most are advised to avoid the ARS. Most also ignore this warning, seeking to take advantage of their lackadaisical attitude toward trade regulation, or to bribe their aggression in a particular direction. In spite of their reputation, or perhaps because of it, they have carved out a niche in Sector politics as a useful tool for more established powers.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Ships[/size][/b]\n<br />The angular ships flown by the Anarakis Reparations Society are designed to keep their enemies at arms length. With only a handful of notable exceptions, their shields are bad, their armor is bad, and their flux wont hold up in an extended firefight. Instead they rely on quick maneuvers and far reaching fire support, afforded by their lightweight hulls and over-engineered weapon mounts respectively. Caught out of position in a face-to-face brawl, many of their hulls will crumble rapidly.\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[b]Weapons[/b][/size]\n<br />Considering the state of their ships, it is no surprise that the Anarakis Reparations Society favors medium to long range weapons, and thus fields a plethora of unique equipment which falls into this category. Much like their ships, these implements have no traceable design lineage, and schematics for them are overwhelmingly physical with little to no consideration for Autoforge compliance. This forces them to rely on the Sector's more ubiquitous offerings to ensure their fleets are fully equipped.[/center]",

This is a short \"pre-release\" to make sure everything new works and I did not break anything else.\n\n```\n - Added MagicAsteroid plugins to restore functionalities related to asteroids that have been removed in the vanilla game (by SafaryJohn)\n     \n - MagicIncompatibleHullmod: now handles hullmods with scripted incompatibilities that have been S-modded by removing the incompatible hullmod added instead of itself. (Thanks to Timid)\n     \n - MagicCampaign: CreateFleet now handles fleets that have a spawn location but no assignment target.\n     \n - MagicBounty: Hopefuly fixed the log spam after a bounty expired.\n```\nThe goal of MagicLib is to create an Open Source, community driven \"library\" of useful (and well documented) scripts and plugins that can be leveraged and contributed to by every modder.\n\nCheck the Wiki for all the details: <https://starsector.fandom.com/wiki/MagicLib>\n\n**Download:** <https://www.patreon.com/posts/66188070>\n\n**Forum:** <http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13718>\n**Nexus:** <https://www.nexusmods.com/starsector/mods/10?tab=files>\n**MagicLab discord:** <https://discord.gg/EVQZaD3naU>\n**Bug report/feedback:** <https://forms.gle/YbQ8cYUA5QaJBCYV8>",

Totally didn't just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I'm not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn't not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts. The only exception is the Lion Guard Falcon, which is about as common as the Lion Guard Eagle from the base SWP mod. Let me know if any ship seems to be spawning too much or too little.\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**\nThis mod requires Ship/Weapon Pack to work!\n\nAdded download link after posting because am stupid:\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24151.0",

As high tech ships, they mostly rely on energy weapons with a few missiles sprinkled here and there. They favor deliberate tactics, using their numerous weapon emplacements to pumel their enemies with long range artillery fire. Slow by nature, they usually rely on dense formations of cruisers with heavy fighter support to keep the enemy at range. While not the flashiest, those ships are reliable and dependable. \n<br />\n<br />   On the campaign layer, the Outer Rim Alliance occupy a large cluster of systems with a solid industrial base and a rich history to explore.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]CONTENT SHOWCASE[/size][/u][/i] \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/8gFduzj.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]Alternate skin packs\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[url=https://i.imgur.com/XzdZxvx.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/XzdZxvxl.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://i.imgur.com/zJcgioI.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/zJcgioIl.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://i.imgur.com/p7NpqkV.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/p7NpqkVl.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://i.imgur.com/popgqtD.jpg.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/popgqtDl.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://i.imgur.com/UkjYJqV.jpg.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/UkjYJqVl.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://i.imgur.com/JFxnRbT.jpg][img]https://i.imgur.com/JFxnRbTl.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />[/spoiler][/center]\n<br />[center]﻿[size=3][i][u]Bug Tracker and Feedback form[/u][/i]:[/size]\n<br />You have some feedback to share and want to make sure I do not miss it?

It should now display and act exactly as configured.\n- Restored Bulk Transport's civilian ship burn bonus and added the corresponding config. \n111h\n- Removed a duplicate Hypercognition skill.

Before the Collapse, the S.C.o.Y. was a nomadic colony built inside an asteroid to travel the stars and study the universe one system at a time. When the Great Collapse occurred and the gate system shutdown the colony became trapped in the Sector, its inhabitants found themselves at the unfortunate center of attention of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the Hegemony and the Luddic Church, all eager to get their hands on Yggdrasill's mini-autofactory and its intact pre-collapse UAC library. Using the gigantic ship as a Cryo-arch, two thirds of the population would escape the crossfire while the rest were put to the stake by Ludd fanatics for worshipping the \"demonic autofactory\".\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿They tried to rebuild their life in a remote system, away from the core worlds Collapse, but circomstances always seems to pull them back, always forcing them[/i][i] to take further extremes measures to ensure their survival.\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]0-ooC-pgCFI[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿This faction mixes all techs in a melting pot of advanced engineering craziness, producing ships and weapons unlike any others.

On the other hand they have slightly more fragile hulls, narrow shields, terrible flux dissipation (relying on venting instead) and fewer weapon mounts. They have to rely on wolf pack tactics to kill isolated targets while the bigger enemies are tied up pursuing smaller prey. Their weapons usually have worse range than vanilla one but superior damage, making even the smallest ship a potential threat if left completely unchecked. When pursued however, they can fold very quickly due to their exposed sides and low staying power.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[i][u][size=4]CONTENT SHOWCASE[/size][/u][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/d8SRBYG.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler][img]https://i.imgur.com/zY39I6F.jpg[/img][/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=3][i][u]Bug Tracker and Feedback form[/u][/i]:[/size]\n<br />You have some feedback to share and want to make sure I do not miss it?

They are now also displayed \"naked\" in refit.\n - All the rare-but-not-unique bounties now have much spicier loadouts.\n - All bounty captains now have better suited skills.\n - Many ship descriptions got a much needed polish pass.\n - Made all the plague-bearer encounters approximatively 267% audio-visually more impressive.```\n\n**Download:** <https://www.patreon.com/posts/61242196>\n\n**Forum:** <http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19414.0>\n**Nexus:** <https://www.nexusmods.com/starsector/mods/50?tab=files>\n**MagicLab discord:** <https://discord.gg/tK3JWBbQ>\n**Bug report/feedback:** <https://forms.gle/YbQ8cYUA5QaJBCYV8>",

Its population waxes and wanes with each atrocity and each acceptance of refugees from the Core, with only the truly most stubborn fools remaining behind.\n\nDue to their desperate circumstances, and a lack of a proper manufactory, the Federation has been forced to utilise whatever they can lay their hands on to use as ships. Consequently, the Federation uses reconstructed Derelict and Remnant ships, or ships reconstructed from derelicts, as their fleet vessels.\n\n**Forum release, no major change from previous Discord Version**\n\n0.0.2\n-Pre-generated systems will no longer spawn in random sector mode (needs a new game).\n-Fixed systems not spawning in Corvus mode\n-Added the Apogee (BRV) and Odyssey (BRV) - subject to change\n-Tweaked some descriptions\n\n0.0.2a\n-Updated for 0.95.1a\n\nDOWNLOAD\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_brighton_0_0_2a.zip",

      "description": "This mod intends to change the way AI officers assigned to automated ships affect the rest of your fleet.\n\nThis mod makes it more viable to have powerful automated fleets. It's possible, for example, to have up to three Radiants in your fleet without suffering any CR maluses. The drawback is an increase in the amount monthly supplies required to keep your ships operational. You'll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I'm open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.2 changelog\n```\n- Fixed NullPointer error when loading the game\n- (Hopefully) fixed negative ship weight bug\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

      "description": "Nobody saw that.\n\nNot save compatible with ***any*** previous versions of the mod.\n\nForeword:\nSo as far as I'm concerned, this mod is now finished. I needed to remove the mod's modularity because hidden modular hardpoints kept breaking other people's mods. As a result, removing the loadout flexibility was a necessary step, as the weapon sprites covered all of the actual ship. It was a necessary step for functionality, but with my own level of skill, I wouldn't be able to preserve my original vision for the mod by doing any decoration weapon wizardry.\n\nSo it was a lot of fun, and I don't regret my time spent on this little endeavour, but this is the final update for SIMP, barring any catastrophic issues that need immediate resolution.\n\nThe tl;dr:\n-Requires Arma Armatura and its dependencies to work.\n-Adds six strikecraft and five fighters.\n-Safe to add, can't verify whether safe to remove.\n\nChanges this patch:\n-All ships have built-in, pre-selected weapon loadouts now.\n-All ships now generate no weapon flux.\n-Flux values drastically reduced to accommodate for weapons no longer creating flux. Flux values are for shields only, now.\n\nChanges last patch:\n-Brought DP costs slightly back up, and increased wing OP costs as well. Even after the rework, they're still way stronger than vanilla fighters, and those values should reflect that. \n\nCredits/Shoutouts:\n-Shoi for designing ARMAA and making this project possible in the first place.\n-CenturionChet for inspiring me to go down this rabbithole  by making his own mod first.\n-Tibby for thinking my kitbashed sprites are cute.\n-Amazigh for advising me about kitbashing's viability when I was initially struggling with spriting.\n-Doogydong for advice on balance revolving around the Raphus.\n-Lavoroxan for more advice around balancing the mod in general!\n-Quartofel for doling out advice as well.\n-Anyone else whose usernames I can't recall off the top of my head, who helped me with my many, many questions.\n-And the entire community.

Additionally, its Fast Missile Racks allows it to deploy a large amount of ordinance in a short time.\n> The Saint, in contrast to the Corkscrew, is a Destroyer with much less numerous armaments, possessing only two large missile hardpoints, two medium ballistic turret mounts, and four small ballistic turret mounts. However with it's limited Missile Autoforge system, it is capable of providing support indefinitely for all but the longest of combats.\n> The Armadillo Cruiser, like the Dart, favours durability over offense. While said to be undergunned by most, they serve as a decent distraction, being not quite undergunned enough to ignore.\n> The Collumbus Cruiser is the little brother to the Conquest, possessing much the same armaments, but in lesser number and on a lighter, faster frame.\n> The Ptero Capital Ship is built around a singular concept: Missile saturation. It's already formidable loadout of four medium missile hardpoints and one large missile hardpoint is further augmented by an unrestricted Missile Autoforge system.\n> The Spear of Persea is designed to pierce enemy battle lines, the Spear is capable of effectively engaging with both broadsides simultaneously.\n\n***Changelog:***\n> Added the Saint-class Destroyer.\n> Reworked the Spear of Persea to make it more Midline.\n> Made the Spear of Persea's quests more accessible.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

A combination of a Flux Shunt and Unstable Containment Fields lets the Sphyrnidae excel despite the normal weaknesses associated with a shield-focused ship at close quarters.\n\n> The Steve-class frieghter is a more armoured version of the Buffalo, designed for a more hostile sector. A Burn Drive and Damper Field allows it to escape pursuit when needed, while a shielded cargo hold helps avert attacks in the first place.\n> The Tiwaz-class Capital is the little brother to the Onslaught. While it lacks the signature Thermal Pulse Cannons, it possesses a higher level of integration than most ships in existence.\n> The Offensive-class Onslaught, in contrast, is a bigger, beefier Onslaught. Much of its bulk is dedicated to its pair of Thermal Pulse Accelerators, allowing it to fire faster and hit harder. It's ship system also received adjustments, being replaced with Manuevering Jets to bring its main weapons on-target quicker.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",

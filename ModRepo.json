There's a bunch of 900su mediums and 1000su larges...\n changelog:\n`weapons:\nleveler/bertha: halved the dmg per shot, but added a breach effect. It's now a more specialized armor cracker as the effect wont deal extra dmg to shield or hull.\ntyrfing: dmg per shot 300 -> 400, dmg per second was kept the same.\nscorpion: nerfed flux/shot and overall accuracy.\ndemohammer: nerfex flux/shot.\nmallet: nerfed the dmg to 2000 and made it cheaper to install.\nnew weapon Heavy Swarmer: large Swarmer with an autoforge and very low op cost.\n\nwings:\nascalon: reduced tachlance range and dmg. \ntalismans: reduced fighter per wing by one and made them cheaper.\nthunderbolts: nerfed its toughness overall, they were way to strong.\nLG variant: now uses a limited ammo HE cannon and a pair of Gazer DEMS. System changed to a single use teleport... yes it will teleport directly to the target when ordered to engage.\n\nships:\ngunther(LG): system changed to a longer range (but longer cooldown) phase skimmer.\nfalcon(LG prototype): added energy bolt coherer.\nTirpitz(baseline):  swapped the builtin talons for talismans.\nSpee(baseline: DP 35 -> 30.\nSpee(P): 100 less armor, 10 more topspeed (and a bit more maneuverability).`\n\n**will break your save if you have V0.9 or lower installed, V09b to V09c is safe**\n\nforum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=18938.0\ndownload: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ZnjzDT4fBNgOC-iAiqpUffPOwDz8xDc/view?usp=sharing",

It provides various simple to use rendering setting and further customization or rewrite methods. Together with several management class to allow for centralized data processing and rendering.\n\n**For players- **Currently BoxUtil provide two types FXAA anti-aliasing option with different quality and spec requirement, this allows fairly good graphic experience when the base game anti-alising is turned off after using GraphicsLib.\n\n[**Notes**\nFor most function of BoxUtil, you must have a graphic card that support OpenGL 4.2 and it requires the game to run on this graphic card for it to operate properly. Instantiated rendering will require at least OpenGL 4.3 support.\n\nYou can check your graphic cards using softwares like GPU-Z. For MacOS, most likely they would not be able to use OpenGL function of higher version.\n\nIf you would need to change game UI zoom, please try to change them in increments of 50%.\n\n**Settings**\nThe mod comes its own config panel on the bottom left, which include two icons, the left one governs basic functions and the right one governs OpenGL4.3 functions.\n\nNormally, if the icon is green, it is usable, if it is red, it is not operational. Clicking them opens a setting panel.\n\nGlobal setting option requires a full restart of the game to function, rest should work after saving the changes. If a setting is red, it is not functional given your current spec.\n\n**TL Note**\nUnfortunately for a dedicated lib like this, most of the more complex function are too complicated for me to understand, let alone translate, so most detailed function explanation may have some mistakes. I have tried my best to outline the main points of the original post, and an english Java doc is enclosed that could help. However, if anyone can provide a better overview, I'd greatly appreciate it.",

Please use \"Save Copy\" before using this mod; in other words, back your save up.\nThe goal of this mod is providing extreme customization; balance isn't on any priority list. Extreme cases will be adjusted but that's pretty much it.\n\nIn addition, this version of the mod WILL NOT be supported by lyravega or Wisp. I am NOT a coder, and therefore am NOT experienced with fixing Java bugs. If you find major issues with this version, please only report them to **ME**, pantsmode, and I will attempt to fix them. Lyra is currently working on refactoring the entire mod from the ground up for its' next addition, and so, cannot assist with fixes on this version. This version WILL NOT be compatible with the next version of EHM released by Lyra as a result.\n\nI *MAY* create a fork of this mod (with Lyra's permission) that has changes that I find might be valuable. This version is *NOT* guaranteed to be save-compatible with the hotfixed version, is *NOT* guaranteed to work, and may *NOT* even release at all.\n\n**If you understand that in full**, feel free to download.\n\nHull Modifications: Will become available immediately\n• Experimental Hull Modifications: Provides a base to all other hull modifications in this mod\n• Over-Engineered: Provides 20% OP bonus and some slot-points to the ship when built-in\n• Logistics Overhaul: Strips the ship of all combat capabilities in favour of logistics\n• Auxiliary Generators: Provides some slot-points in exchange for ordnance points\n• AI Switch: Turns automated ships into normal, or normal ships into automated ones\n\nHull Modification Categories: Will become available immediately\n• Systems: Most vanilla systems are turned into hull modifications\n• Retrofits: Alters the weapon slots of a ship all together\n• Cosmetics: Fully customizable hull modifications to change shield and engine colours. Customization is done through the mod settings menu\n• Activators: Uses slot shunts to provide the ship with various enhancements by altering the slot they're installed on\n\nSlot Shunt Categories: May be obtained after activating the new ability. These, along with their activators alter the ship in different ways\n• Adapters: Turns a bigger slot into smaller versions (3 large, 1 medium types)\n• Converters: Turns a smaller slot into a bigger one by using slot points (1 medium, 1 small types)\n• Diverters: Turns a slot inactive and yield slot points to be used by above (1 small type)\n• Capacitors: Enhances the total flux capacity of the ship (1 small type)\n• Dissipators: Enhances the total flux dissipation of the ship (1 small type)\n• Launch Tubes: Turns a large slot into a fighter hangar (1 large type)\n\n```ansi\n\u001b[2;32m+ Save compatible; safe to install/update\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2;31m- Cannot be removed; back your save up\u001b[0m\n```\n\nDependencies: LunaLib: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25658.0 & LazyLib: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=5444.0\nDownload Link: 0.8.7HF2: https://files.catbox.moe/vtvtcl.zip",

      "description": "This mod is built on a sort of library I'm referring to as True Input Faker, which it uses to generate fake mouse events (and possibly fake keyboard events in the future) by injecting itself between Starsector and the LWJGL game library it's built on.\n\nMostly a proof of concept, this mod is a simplistic \"accessibility\" mod that allows using the keyboard to control the in-game cursor. This includes using the keyboard for:\n* Left clicks\n* Right clicks\n* Mouse movement\n* Scrolling\n* Click-and-hold/drag\n\nThis isn't entirely ergonomic, and there are still some quirks/bugs (notably, basically all input except mouse movement, scrolling and clicks will not be processed when an inventory item stack is selected).\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, everything in the game that requires a mouse can be controlled via the keyboard with this mod, even the combat layer though it's extremely difficult to do so. There's also plenty of overlap between the default keybinds I've chosen and the game's keybinds, though those can be reconfigured fairly easily.\n\nRequires LazyLib.\nOptionally depends on LunaLib for editing keybinds.\n\nSource: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/true-input-faker>\nDownload: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/true-input-faker/releases/download/0.0.1/true-input-faker.zip>",

Hope you enjoy!\n-Adjusted Sweeper SHotgun damage from 50 to 100 per shot, flux per shot to 100 from 50.\nI noticed some very bad performance as an anti-armor gun, therefore this buff should solve all the issues it has.\n-Added Dragonfire RC (Remote control) Pod to the Skysplitter (M).\n-Added Crawler Autocannon\n-Adjusted Mark IX Rotary to 300 damage from 200, Flux/second from 200 to 300.\nSo these Autocannons for Mayasura are meant to be high damage. This means they can also punch through armor in a pinch.\n-Added in Sidekick\nThis is a uzi type weapon that you can get for your large ballistic slot for a pretty cheap amount of OP.\n-Orchard Burst size from 2 to 4",

Hyperstorms will cause these clouds to zap anyone who draws near them, periodically, with a very powerful EMP bolt.\nBlack Holes: Drags all entities in combat towards the black hole, and increases time dilation of all ships.\nPulsars: Pushes all entities in combat away from the pulsar, reduces shield stats (efficiency, more upkeep, emp arc pierce chance), slowly generates hardflux, randomly EMPs ships, and charges all projectiles with a flat bonus to EMP damage.\nMeson Field (More Planetary Conditions): Normally increases non-missile weapon range and vision range by a moderate amount, but in storms significantly increases all weapon range, wing range, system range, and vision range.```\n\nAdditionally, adds combat effects to campaign objectives. Fight near your comms relay to get bonus CP regen!\n\n**Safe to add and remove from saves.**\n\nDownload: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/releases\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/MoreCombatTerrainEffects/tree/master\nForum thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=25567.0",

I first started modding back in 2019, before going on hiatus and coming back around 0.97, at which point I found out to my amazement that my source code *mostly* still worked!\n\nContains:\n- one capital, three cruisers, three destroyers, and two frigates. Generally high tech with light armor, high movement speed, high flux capacity, but relatively low flux dissipation, offset by a universal hullmod for shielded ships that reduces flux costs when shields are off for a high risk/reward playstyle. They also lose zero-flux bonus when they sustain hull damage, to make them less frustrating to play against them when they have long-ranged weapons.\n- 5 fighter LPCs (still trying to figure out fighter balance in general)\n- About 30 or so factional weapons, including 3 types of missiles and a bunch of energy, synergy, and hybrid types. Energy weapons generally deal less damage with worse efficiency than most energy weapons, but longer range. The beams are the opposite--more damage than common beam weapons, but less range.\n- One modular hullmod (Plasma Aggregator)\n- A star system with independent/pirate markets including special submarkets that sell NCA gear (since they don't have any official market)\n- Graphicslib integration (normal maps only), plus fancy lights and doodads.",

I have balanced the output to be as near to the input in value and all new custom commodities are effected by market demand valuation using their base commodity demand.

Previously this only occurred if an update to this mod was also detected.\n- Improved addition of newly added operations to more closely resemble initial spawn distribution\n\nPerilous Expanse only:\n- Increased threshold for fuel reduction bonus of Bulk Transport skill from 2000 to 6000\n```\n\nFull change log: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases> (shared with Nomadic Survival)\nDownload: <https://github.com/NateNBJ/NomadicSurvival/releases/latest/download/Perilous.Expanse.zip>",

Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nConqueror- Midline battleship, fast but very poor rear arcs.  Comes with 2 fighter bays.\nJavelin- Midline cruiser with AAF.  Main armament is 4 medium ballistics.\nPolaris- Midline battlecarrier with reloading Harpoon launchers.\nViper- Midline frigate with AAF.\nBarrage-Capital ship made out of station parts.  Slow, but heavy firepower.\nViking -Missile frigate\nWarhawk- Very mobile cruiser, based on the Falcon. \nHurricane-  high tech frigate with Terminator drones.\nVulcan-  cross between the Onslaught and Conquest.\nTriumphant-  broadside capital ship with heavy armor.\n\n## Weapons ##\nDevastation- Large slot HE ballistic weapon.   Will show up in mercenary fleets occasionally.\nMjolnir Heavy Cannon- Triple-barrel Mjolnir, good luck finding something with the flux to use this well. \nAutopulse Beam- Designed as a shitpost, is just an Autopulse Laser that was turned into a beam weapon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nPlasma Beam- Similar to the Autopulse Beam, but based on the Plasma Cannon.  Does not spawn in NPC fleets/markets currently.\nTachyon Accelerator- Projectile variant of Tachyon Lance.  Does not pierce shields.\nLight Mjolnir- Single-barrel Mjolnir, fits in medium slots.\nHeavy Positron Cannon- Hybrid large weapon.  Probably needs more balancing.\nPositron Cannon- Hybrid medium weapon.  \nPiledriver Heavy Railcannon- Large kinetic ballistic. \nHarpoon Missile Battery-Large slot Harpoon launcher.\nPhase Beam Battery- triple phase beam in a large slot.  High damage output, bad range and slightly less flux efficient than the standard Phase Lance.\nFlash HVM- Very maneuverable missile with a relatively short lockon range.  Great against lighter ships, and comes in small, medium, and large sizes.\n\n## Wings ##\nWildcat- DEM bomber\n\nCan be added mid-playthrough and should function correctly if done.\n\nForum link: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=28822.0\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354960414013657320/1365808180134809731/random_weapon_collection-0.1.1.zip?ex=680ea77d&is=680d55fd&hm=b9ffea7bc26a98d36b06e1e5d7a07a6fa5e77d5838944d3d2c656cc88a9b6a28&\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354960414013657320/1365808180914946149/all_ships_0.1.1.png?ex=680ea77d&is=680d55fd&hm=596a16a1d598beb05c6986523527f100b56dac56cbefafb224c7ac85ad54dcea&",

Campaign support is nearly complete for the most common UI's, but for late-game stuff like colony management UI's, don't expect much. \n\nChangelog:\n``` - Added support for character sheet tab\n - Added support for fleet tab\n - Added support for Refit tab (incredibly basic, mostly just a mouse emulator)\n - Tweaked support for crew/cargo tab so that navigating from it to the adjacent tabs works\n - Added support for map tab (mostly a mouse editor, but it does support toggling sector/system view)\n - Added support for the intel tabs (including support for the main Intel, planets, and faction sub-tabs)\n - Added support for the Command tab (same as Refit currently, just a mouse emulator)\n - On the main campaign view, added support for selecting ship abilities/hotkeys, the current ability is highlighted with a yellow reticle, and you press B to activate the selected ability.\n - Added support for various message boxes that show up throughout the game, for instance the one that shows in campaign view when supplies run low.\n - Tons of small little bugfixes that I can't hope to list```\n\nDownload: https://github.com/katemonster33/SSMSControllerEx/releases/download/v1.3/SSMSControllerEx.zip",

More like a splash of occasional spice, instead of ever present or not present at all.\n - Adjusted mount on the voulge to be aligned\n - Fix invincibility issue on bosses if a ship is under them when they warp in\n - Redhand start again prevents red hand bounty from showing up.\n - Voulge custom start now shows nexerelin starting bonuses ui for the colony.\n - Voulge custom start now removes debt from the initial time pass.\n - Pre existing bounties now show up in the MagicLib bounty board. (need magiclib version 1.5.7 or above)\n - Fixed crash on game load, where every fleet's flagship name is read, and thus crashes if a fleet for some reason doesn't have a flagship.\n```\nThanks to Unofficial Updater for informing me of several of these bugs and giving me advice.",

      "description": "Add a mid-tech battle group. Having some vanilla-like ships. Having some special faction weapons, but all of these are build-in their ships. \n\nStarsector Mod by Yisic/Diling\nProofread by Mycophobia\n\nRequires Graphic Lib/Lazy Lib/Magic Lib/Nex\n\n```Lore```\nXXVII - Shakeles Garrison\nShackles Garrison is comprised of the remnants of the XXVII Battlegroup, disillusioned with human rule after being left adrift for an extended period of time after the Collapse, seeing themselves as abandoned by the rest of humanity. Their arrival in the Sector was originally marked by a willingness to collaborate, but the geopolitically volatile environment of the Sector caused them to be embroiled in significant conflict with both Tri-Tachyon Technology and the Hegemony. These conflicts resulted in the annihilation of the Garrison's capital planet and significant fleet losses, forcing the faction to retreat to a small star system outside of the Core Worlds.\n\nThe net effect of these conflicts was to transform the Shackles Garrison from a disillusioned, somewhat cynical, but fundamentally collaborative faction with a decently-sized military force into a civilization driven almost exclusively by revenge. Specifically, a cold, patient, seething determination to exact vengeance on those who ultimately killed billions of their people, after they had arrived in the Sector with cooperative intentions. For now, they were weak, beaten, unthreatening - but they would bide their time, marshal their forces, sharpen their blades - and then there would be hell to pay.\n\nIt will be better if you start your new run after you finish all XXVII missions. Because those missions will give you some reward. \n\n``Newest Ver is: v1.0.0\n``\n```Download```\nGithub(English version): https://github.com/dilinganye/XXVIIBattleGroup_EN/releases/tag/Shakeles_Garrsion_V1.0.0\n\nIf that one can't working, try that file upload below.",

      "description": "***Warning:** We __strongly recommend__ setting your frame rate cap in data/config/settings.json to **at least 120** to avoid AI and hit detection issues!*\n\nEver wish the game would go by quicker while you're flying your lumbering Paragon up to the line of battle?  Ever wanted to push \"fast forward\" while your fleet mopped up the remnants of an enemy fleet?  Ever wanted to speed through a trivial Derelicts fight?  This mod is for you!\n\nHold the middle mouse button and the game becomes 2x faster.  You can also press the caps lock key to toggle fast mode at your leisure.  The B button toggles the slow-down effect of phase systems.\n\nThe following are *NOT RECOMMENDED* for pitched battles due to causing problems with AI and hit detection: F3 applies a 6x multiplier, and control-capslock causes the game to run in as-fast-as-possible mode.\n\nControls are fully customizable by editing SpeedUp/data/config/SPEED_UP.json.  You can even set custom time scaling factors on separate inputs, if you like.\n\n\n```Version 1.2.2 (April 7, 2025)\n- Updated for Starsector 0.98a-RC7\n- Improved the calculation for calculating dynamic speed multipliers\n\nVersion 1.2.1 (March 31, 2025)\n- Updated for Starsector 0.98a\n- Fixed a logical bug preventing dynamic changes in speed multipliers```\n\nDownload: https://bitbucket.org/DarkRevenant/speedup/downloads/SpeedUp_1.2.2.7z\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13394.0",

While not as expansive as hullmods, this collection will still make stations just a bit more engaging.\n\nAugments can be find by salvaging and at markets, and are an uncommon find. They do NOT dilute the loot pool, instead adding more loot in total. Augments can also be obtained by destroying a station with augments.\nAugments are also applied to NPC markets, including modded markets.\n\nThe entire augment system was designed with other mods in mind, meaning other mods can create their own augments and apply augments to their own markets without a hard dependency.\n\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=30583.0\nRepo: https://github.com/nikothedude/Station-Augments\nDownload: https://github.com/nikothedude/Station-Augments/releases/",

      "description": "The Second Battlegroup is an elite line of ships that can be found as derelict outside of the Core Systems (Like XIV Legion). But for gameplay purposes, their blueprint can also be found individually. \n\nTheir combat doctrine is \"Adamantium Lance\" which focuses on using overwhelming firepower to break through the enemy lines. They usually emphasize large, frontal weaponry while ignoring point defence, and some ships have slightly modified weapon arcs to perfect their job.\n\nTheir Battlegroup bonus is quite similar to the XIV, but the bonus and penalty are all increased. Overall, they are stronger than XIV ships. Due to the change in weapon systems, they usually cost 20-25% more DP compared to their vanilla counterparts and cost 3x as much (XIV ships cost 1.75x). Auxiliary ships have lower bonuses and less radical restructuring, so they only cost 1.5x as much.\n\n```Changelog:\nv1.0.0: Release\nv1.0.1: Fixed the bugs that the Lance of Oblivion will turn and Player fleet won't spawn these ship even if it has the blueprint\nv1.0.2: Added II ships to title screen and sim battle\nv1.1.0: Added Champion (II)\nv1.2.0: Added Kite (II) (A) and Shepherd (II) (A). Also changed the color of Second Battlegroup Auxilia design.\n```\n\nDownload: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MzW5_E48iNYDoDUmlNdeV9aNSXeL1Kb7/view?usp=sharing\nForum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=33081.0",

Hycean planets are now rarer.\n   . Ores, Rare Ores and Ruins are slightly worse.\n   . Organics are considerably worse\n   . Atmospheric conditions tend to favour Thin Atmosphere.\n- Reverted Military Virus production bonus to +3 (was +4).\n- Fixed Crashed Drone having an incorrect size 6 effect.\n- Some minor optimization to stat calculations to prevent weird rounding errors.\n```\n\nIf you've been using an older version by manually updating the version number then it should be save compatible but no guarantees.\n\nDownload: <https://github.com/JamesTripleQ/Unknown-Skies/releases/latest>\nForum post: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=29876.0>\nOriginal forum post: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=12041.0>",

      "description": "This mod adds support for using a controller in Starsector. Currently works on the title screen, certain spots in campaign, and in combat. Based heavily off the good work by razuhl with his SSMSController mod https://github.com/razuhl/SSMSController \n\nRequires LunaLib & LazyLib\n\nCurrent controllers supported:\n- On windows, PS4, Switch Pro, and XBox 360\n- On Linux, PS4, Switch Pro, and Steam Deck\nIf your controller is unsupported, a special button auto-mapper UI will appear on the title screen prompting you to enter the button corresponding with a given button icon on the screen. Once it's finished, the controller should work\n\nPatch notes for v1.1 \n> Campaign view:\n>  - Added support for using controller on the campaign view, you can point the ship in a direction with the left joystick and use the A button to move the ship.\n>  - Added support for using the controller in multi-choice dialogs, use up-down on the joystick to choose an option and A to select\n> Combat view:\n>  - Added support for closing the message box that shows above the deployment view the first time you enter the screen\n>  - Added support for the deployment UI, use up-down to toggle the focus between the ships and the buttons and use A to click a button or deploy a ship.\n>  - Added VERY VERY basic support for the war room, really just the ability to pause/unpause, and close the war room (aka switch to ship control)\n> General bugfixes:\n>  - The on-screen controller mappings now show as a proper window with a border, this keeps it from blending in with the screen\n>  - Right trigger wasn't working properly, ship would thrust forever unless you held left trigger, should be fixed now\n>  - Left/right bumper weren't mapped properly on Steam Deck on Linux, should be fixed now\n>  - Left/right trigger weren't mapped properly on PS4 controller on Windows\n>  - Support for salvage view and market view are coming \n\n[Download link](https://github.com/katemonster33/SSMSControllerEx/releases/download/v1.1/SSMSControllerEx_v1.1.zip)",

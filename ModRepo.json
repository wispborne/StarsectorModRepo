      "description": "Forum Thread: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21280.0\nDownload: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/releases\n\nThis mod gives you more control over the way weapon groups behave when on autofire. For each weapon group, you can select one or more tags, such as e.g. holding fire when flux > X% or avoiding shields, to customise how that group should behave. Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux > 50%) and two ~~badly~~  expertly done GUIs.\nCan be added/removed/updated to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\n1.6.0 fixes some minor issues, adds two new tags (Range<N% and ShipTarget) and makes the combat GUI lib usable for mod authors (cf. https://github.com/DesperatePeter/test-combat-gui-lib)\n\nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: Instead of suggested modes/suffixes, you can now list suggested tags for your weapons in modSettings.json. If you had already added weapon modes/suffxies, feel free to leave them in for compatibility  with older versions.  (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/master/data/config/modSettings.json#L16 for an example). \nFor details on how to add tags to enemy ships: https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control#assigning-tags-to-enemy-ship-weapons\n\nPlease let me know if you encounter any issues or have some feedback!\n\nThanks in advance and happy gaming/modding!",

Inshallah I will be permitted to buff a few things after it is over.\n\n```- Thunderstorm SLRM: Removed hard flux on shield hit from frag mines. Reduced mine attraction speed (60 -> 30), frag mine armor strip (50 -> 25), frag mine damage (600 -> 500), and missile HP (450 -> 400).\n- Arcspikes/Arcstorm: reduced damage (125 -> 110), EMP (200 -> 175) and top speed (700 -> 550). Reduced Canister Pod range (1500 -> 1200).\n- Arcmine Dispenser: Reduced mine arc radius (400 -> 300). Reduced charge regen (10s -> 12s). AI is now slightly more hesitant to spend all its charges at once.\n- Toroid Mortar: Fixed a minor graphical bug (this is a buff).```\n\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=22704\nDirect Download: https://github.com/theDragn/ApexDesignCollective/releases/download/1.0.10/Apex.Design.Collective_1.0.10b.zip",

Requires a new game to see the changes, but old saves will work fine (mostly)\n- Changed the 0-Series Nevermore from BRDY-Rare to BRDY_Rare.

Its founding dates back to a pre-Collapse powerful smuggling ring, with ties to many of the equipment testing units of the Domain of Man, selling prototypes to various corporations at high prices. With the failure of the Gates, the upper echelons of the syndicate were trapped in a secret warehouse in Perseus. Knowing that the power at their disposal was far from sufficient to protect the precious cargo in the warehouse, they relied on the mountains of supplies within to completely disappear from the incoming disputes and set up the FSF predecessor as an underground organization.\n\nIn the golden age after the First AI War, the sporadic appearance of foreign trade warships that people had never seen before in the defense of the Edge World colonies symbolized the FSF's emergence on the Perseus scene as the giant corporation known today for providing, among other things, shipbuilding, military instruction, and weapons trade. Although they have always been a mega-corporation following the laws of the Hegemony throughout the Sector, in recent years their fleet numbers have risen steeply to show their ambition.```\nAdds the eponymous faction, a few new mechanics, a quest alongside a plethora or ships and weapons.\n\nNote that release may have some translation errors or idiosyncrasies.

Brought to you lovingly after a week of testing.\n\n```\nPacks Included:\n- JRE7 Safe Pack\n- JRE8 Safe/Aggresive/Dangerous Pack\n- For 1/2/3/4/6/8GB\n- G1GC Hide Leak Messages mods\n```\n\nKey differences between packs\nAll share the same trait of having a low latency multi-threaded GC (the janitor you may call it) to reclaim unused memory and make the game smooth. For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who're curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn't launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you're using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.4 Changes*\n\n-Both Fang and Draco have had their markets beefed up, and their faction stats overhauled.\n-Added spicy boss-ish fleets to Phylum and Prestor John systems.\n-Added Two MagicBounties, giving you a chance to find and use some truly despicable boats.\n-Fiddled with a lot of the stats.\n-Lots of tiny little fixes.\n\n*Savegame Compatible, but beyond the MagicBounties you won't see new stuff without a new game*\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_4.zip",

Save-compatible.\n\nBugfix: Encountering a Shoebill heavy cruiser no longer causes Mac users to crash (lmao)\n\nChanges:\n- Fissure LRM: Reworked into a long-range giga-Breach. No longer splits; sprint stage velocity reduced. Deals a large amount of unreduced armor damage over a large area.\n- Ahab Harpoon Stream: Reworked into Ahab Harpoon Repeater. Fires three Harpoons at once. Lots of ammo, quick fire time, but small salvos are easy to intercept.\n- Toroidal Plasma Railguns: Reduced OP (12 -> 11 and 26 -> 22). They're kinda weak (and intended to be weak) despite their range, so they shouldn't have premium OP costs.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/theDragn/HTE/releases/download/1.4.10/HTE_1.4.10.zip\nForum: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19548",

Planets captured or colonized by KoT will gain Decivilized Subpopulation after (10 * planet size) days. This can be reversed if another faction recaptures the planet before this time. (Planet capture/transfer requires Nexerelin or similar.)\n- New dockside bar art & description for KoT planets.

Totally didn't just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I'm not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn't not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts. The only exception is the Lion Guard Falcon, which is about as common as the Lion Guard Eagle from the base SWP mod. Let me know if any ship seems to be spawning too much or too little.\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**\nThis mod requires Ship/Weapon Pack to work!\n\nAdded download link after posting because am stupid:\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24151.0",

It should now display and act exactly as configured.\n- Restored Bulk Transport's civilian ship burn bonus and added the corresponding config. \n111h\n- Removed a duplicate Hypercognition skill.

It's possible, for example, to have up to three Radiants in your fleet without suffering any CR maluses. The drawback is an increase in the amount monthly supplies required to keep your ships operational. You'll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I'm open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.2 changelog\n```\n- Fixed NullPointer error when loading the game\n- (Hopefully) fixed negative ship weight bug\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

      "description": "Nobody saw that.\n\nNot save compatible with ***any*** previous versions of the mod.\n\nForeword:\nSo as far as I'm concerned, this mod is now finished. I needed to remove the mod's modularity because hidden modular hardpoints kept breaking other people's mods. As a result, removing the loadout flexibility was a necessary step, as the weapon sprites covered all of the actual ship. It was a necessary step for functionality, but with my own level of skill, I wouldn't be able to preserve my original vision for the mod by doing any decoration weapon wizardry.\n\nSo it was a lot of fun, and I don't regret my time spent on this little endeavour, but this is the final update for SIMP, barring any catastrophic issues that need immediate resolution.\n\nThe tl;dr:\n-Requires Arma Armatura and its dependencies to work.\n-Adds six strikecraft and five fighters.\n-Safe to add, can't verify whether safe to remove.\n\nChanges this patch:\n-All ships have built-in, pre-selected weapon loadouts now.\n-All ships now generate no weapon flux.\n-Flux values drastically reduced to accommodate for weapons no longer creating flux. Flux values are for shields only, now.\n\nChanges last patch:\n-Brought DP costs slightly back up, and increased wing OP costs as well. Even after the rework, they're still way stronger than vanilla fighters, and those values should reflect that. \n\nCredits/Shoutouts:\n-Shoi for designing ARMAA and making this project possible in the first place.\n-CenturionChet for inspiring me to go down this rabbithole  by making his own mod first.\n-Tibby for thinking my kitbashed sprites are cute.\n-Amazigh for advising me about kitbashing's viability when I was initially struggling with spriting.\n-Doogydong for advice on balance revolving around the Raphus.\n-Lavoroxan for more advice around balancing the mod in general!\n-Quartofel for doling out advice as well.\n-Anyone else whose usernames I can't recall off the top of my head, who helped me with my many, many questions.\n-And the entire community.

Do you have so many ships in your game that your Simulation's Deployment screen takes 10 seconds to load and tanks your framerate while open?\n\nYou probably answered no to most/all of these questions, but to the few who are still reading, congratulations! I made a tool specifically to address this niche issue. SSOS is an interactive Python script that allows you to instantly strip those pesky sim_opponent.CSVs from all of your mods, leaving you with a smooth and uncluttered Deployment screen.
